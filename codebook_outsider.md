# Examples of Outside View and Dialectic Thinking

## Codebook

Both outside view and dialectic thinking are coded on a 0-1 scale:

-   A 0 indicates that the theme *is not present* in the participant's response

-   A 1 indicates that the theme *is present* in the participant's response.

## Outsider View

**Definition:** The participant explicitly brings up examples from either (a) past pandemics or (b) other base rate info / prior information to inform their predictions. Notably, their predictions must be informed by prior trends that they reference in their answer. These trends can include research (their own or other's), historical data, and/or data related to the trends they are predicting.

**How to code this category:** Participant responses to questions 1 & 3 are coded individually / in isolation. This means that all participants should have a separate Outside Thinking code for both question 1 (predicted positive change) and question 3 (predicted negative change).

**Examples:**

-   *what we know is that work on resilience, such as the work of George Bonanno, has shown that even after very extreme traumatic stressors, many people do just fine.* They exhibit resilience, about half of people across lots of different studies, even in the face of very extreme forms of stress. You know, their mental health and functioning remain high throughout. For the rest of people, we see about half of them so maybe 25%, maybe one third of people will experience a transient increase and symptoms like depression and anxiety that that go away over time. And that pattern is likely what we\'ll see here as well. But we also see that a smaller proportion of people anywhere from 15 to 30%, depending on the study experience increases in mental health problems like depression and anxiety that are going to persist over time, that may become more chronic.

-   *I\'m looking into what happened in 1913 influenza pandemic. And people are really, you know, impacted by that pandemic back then. But there was no significant psychological, societal change afterward.* So I\'m not sure if there\'s any significant changes happening automatically.

-   I would say that in as a scientist, one thing we know is that the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. So, *when you look at past epidemics, you can see that in a crisis like like this, like the, the, the flu epidemic and others, similar, you know, Spanish flu epidemic and at the turn of the century and other epidemics,* one aspect of social life that could have that did in some ways get better, in certain ways, was the stratification of society and to some extent, some forms of racism.

-   *Actually, in my own research on the Great East Japan earthquake in the nine years ago, the in Japan suggested that people re-evaluate their ordinary lives and the strengths and their feelings of the gratitude towards family members or social networks.*

## Dialectical Thinking

**Definition:** Dialectic Thinking refers to instances where the interviewees either (a) highlight how the same issue or topic can have both positives and negatives, or (b) indicate a large degree of uncertainty in their predictions in a manner that recognizes that the situation could play out in multiple different ways.

-   *Now obviously, that\'s all quite negative. But one of the positive aspects of this might be that it even though it exacerbates poverty and inequality*, it might shift our attitudes towards those things in a way that ultimately might have more of a positive effect.

-   I expect that we will continue to live in a world of reduced mobility for the foreseeable future, even after lockdowns have been lifted completely, so we\'re going to, most likely, I will continue to avoid crowds and strangers traveling overseas participating in large events unless we have to and so on.... *There\'s of course a lot of good that can come out of this shift. But one potential negative outcome would be to think that online virtual interactions can replace face to face and physical ones.*

-   family will become more important than ever. *Due to social distancing during this pandemic, our social life has been substantially diminished. However, very ironically, our close relationships, especially family became more crucial in our happiness.*

-   *these are terrible questions, by the way. They are unanswerable. I mean, that there are so many things to be said about them, including predictions are always wrong. There is no that there\'s nothing just positive or everything that looks positive as negative, undesirable consequences.* It\'s just there are so many layers to bet that one doesn\'t get to, to express. Well, let me first say that, as we all know, predictions are hard, especially when they are about the future.

-   *There\'s an ancient Greek saying "There\'s nothing bad without something good in it." And a modern Greek philosopher enhanced this saying by adding "and good and bad always come in the same amount."* One needs to ponder this for a while to fully appreciate this validity.

-   *One positive note might be that we realize that this kind of pandemics, or these kinds of global events, can only be solved if we work together as a community, as a word community.* And that\'s does not only mean different countries working together, but also working together between rich and poor**...** Well, that\'s the other side of the coin, right? *I mean, where we have the positive side, we\'re realizing that we have to work together on this to overcome this. The other side of the coin is exactly that we become more self-centered and looking out for number one, and my tribe, which we have be seeing in the United States.*

-   *I can certainly say I don\'t have a clue, but I can make some guesses with fairly low confidence.*
