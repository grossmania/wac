Political Science,,Anand Menon,Menon,,"We are probably going to be more appreciative of people we didn't appreciate enough before. That might be friends and neighbors that have kept each other going through lockdown that might in our country, at least, be health service workers who have been the focus of a lot of sort of attention during this. It might even be immigrants, because the Prime Minister himself came out of this thanking people who weren't from the UK who helped save his life when he went into hospital. That's the first thing. The second thing is that the crisis has helped bring to the fore the issue of economic inequality, the fact that people have precarious work, the fact that people might not have enough to live on, the fact that some key workers don't get paid very much at all. And it might be that we end up with a greater sustained public and political attention paid to that issue that has been certainly in this country in the recent past.",,0,0,0,,,,0,0,0
Cultural Psychology,Social Psychology,Ayse Uskul,Uskul,,"This pandemic has underscored societal inequalities along age, class, ethnic, regional and gender lines. The pandemic has not caused these inequalities, but it's put a spotlight on them. Disease affects certain ethnic and age groups more than others, a woman's contribution to the economy is likely to be hit harder than man's, and those who have entered COVID-19 with ongoing major problems such as poverty, political instability, and corruption, will have a harder time coming out of it in one piece. Alongside of all this, we have also realized one more time, that we all depend on each other in our lives are interconnected in so many different ways. I expect and perhaps more so hope, that this picture will motivate us to work towards understanding why this pandemic hits certain groups harder than others. As a result, it will motivate us to pick up a stronger fight against the unfair distribution of resources and rights not just where we live, but much more globally. ","This pandemic caused people to live in lockdowns and following this experience I expect that we will continue to live in a world of reduced mobility for the foreseeable future, even after lockdowns have been lifted completely, most likely, I will continue to avoid crowds and strangers, traveling overseas, participating in large events unless we have to and so on. And this is likely to affect technological developments in every possible domain of life, not just when it comes to how we socialize with friends and family from our homes, but also how we work, how legal and medical advice and services are delivered, how we vote, how we teach our pupils and students and so on. There's of course a lot of good that can come out of this shift. But one potential negative outcome would be to think that online virtual interactions can replace face to face and physical ones. Research shows very clearly that in person interactions are qualitatively different when it comes to how they affect our mental well-being, our self-concept, our physiology and so on. Coming to the conclusion that life can continue online without physical human contact would be, in my view, one very negative consequence of this pandemic. ",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1
Moral Psychology,Social Psychology,Azim Shariff,Shariff,,"One of the positive aspects of this might be that it even though it exacerbates poverty and inequality, it might shift our attitudes towards those things in a way that ultimately might have more of a positive effect. Across the world, there's great variation in terms of how people attribute the causes of poverty. How they balance attributions towards dispositional causes, that poverty is due to bad decision making or laziness, something internal to the person or to situational causes, exogenous causes, situations, bad luck, lack of opportunity. Since the pandemic has been such a great, and obvious example of an exogenous shock, something that's out of people's immediate personal control, it looks like it has changed people's general attitude towards the causes of poverty, not just their specific recognition that the pandemic has made the economic hardship of the poor worse, but that, in general, the causes of economic hardship for the poor, tend to be these situational things. There is some data that we have  and it showed that the shift that people have towards recognizing that poverty is more the consequence of the situational rather than dispositional causes, drives more sympathy for the poor. And as a result, more support for redistributive policies. We’ve already seen that in the political sphere with a resurgence of a discussion of a universal basic income, something that's being taken more seriously now than it ever has before. The lasting positive legacy, of the pandemic might be a greater recognition of the unfair challenges that many of the people in our society face. And that's a commitment to a more egalitarian, collective approach to these challenges.","One of the most negative, I think, is actually interestingly, and maybe even paradoxically, related to one of the more positive, and that has to do with the plight of the poor. Both in terms of absolute poverty, as well as inequality, this has been bad. We've made tremendous progress over the last decades in terms of reducing the number of people living in extreme poverty around the world, a lot of that progress has been set back by the economic fallout of the pandemic. And that's tragic. In North America, we're likely to see that inequality trends, which have already been going in the wrong direction, are likely to be exacerbated by this. One of the reasons why is because of the unequal educational opportunities. So in the best of times, elementary and high school kids tend to see what we call a summer learning loss, which is that over the summer months, a lot of what they've learned during the school year regresses, both in terms of their mathematical ability and their verbal ability. But unfortunately, that's bad enough, it's not equally distributed among the economic spectrum. The richest kids actually see a boost because they go back to a home environment that's actually quite enriched. School tends to be the equalizer. But when the students go back to their homes, they go back to very different environments, the poorer students go back to the least enriched environments, have the least opportunities for this enrichment, and as a result, they see the steepest declines in their learning. Now, one of the worst things about this is that those inequalities accumulate over the years, which leads ultimately to a substantial achievement gap between the rich and poor, caused predominantly by what happens when they're out of school, rather than differences when they're in school. What this pandemic has brought is that on steroids. First of all, the summer period, when students were out of school was much longer, twice as long and it might continue. Furthermore, there was some expectation that students were supposed to learn remotely or at home, or get school taught, those opportunities were not equally distributed as well, due to unequal access to technology or parents having different abilities to homeschool given their work schedules. As a result, we're likely to see stark inequalities that may last for decades, we've already seen some preliminary data in terms of these abilities sliding and sliding at different pitches. If they accumulate, which they likely will with the rest of the summer learning losses, we might see certain students falling behind for the rest of their lives. ",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1

Social Psychology,,Barry Schwartz,Schwartz,,"What the pandemic has done is, it made people appreciate relationships with other people more since that's been so dramatically taken away. At least in affluent Western societies, we seem to be chasing stuff more, and people less, and this may get us to rearrange our priorities. Relatedly, and this comes to the surface, especially in connection with wearing masks in public, it may enhance our concern for the welfare of other people rather than just ourselves. It's been undersold, that wearing masks is mostly to protect other people from you, and less to protect you from other people. If that had been sold more so that you would, in a sense, had this feeling of public responsibility for the welfare of others every time you went outside. I think that would enhance our sense that we're all in this together, I think we have not taken sufficient advantage of the opportunity to emphasize that as a culture. Focusing less on me and more on we is likely to be a positive outcome.","When people are threatened, when people perceive real danger, they kind of pull in, and they focus entirely on themselves. And so it seems to me in a moment of enormous uncertainty and high risk, one way to go is to worry about the welfare of other people. Another way to go is to essentially erase the welfare of other people from your consideration altogether and wake up every day with the idea that it's all about me. I don't think anyone does, it partly depends on how long it lasts, it partly depends on how much more serious it becomes as a health problem. It partly depends on how much more serious it becomes as an economic problem. But I can see people at one another's throats in a few months, rather than looking to provide aid. I think we have to really worry about the anti-social consequences, immoral consequences that could arise if the situation gets desperate enough. I don't know what you can do about it except to have your eyes open and try to find ways to step in and ameliorate if this negative turn starts to appear.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1
Health Psychology,Clinical Psychology,Crystal Park,Park,,"Well, first of all, I have to say that, frankly, we may not see any changes whatsoever in the in the long run, or even in the medium run, because the people tend to kind of revert to their baseline pretty quickly after major positive and major negative events, for the most part. But on a more hopeful note, if we do see something positive, perhaps it will be that we recognize that we are more adaptable than we have often thought of ourselves. And in this time of the pandemic, people have done a lot of amazingly creative things to meet needs that were unable to be met in the usual ways, and have been remarkably adaptable to a whole new world. And so perhaps some of that sense of being more resilient and adaptable will persist. Another thing that may have happened is that we've had a realization of how interconnected the world is that people and places around the globe are connected. And perhaps this will have even some hopeful, positive effects on our ability to manage climate change. Because of the interconnectedness of the world, you know, what happened in China affects the whole world, what happens in different parts of our own society affect an entire society.   ","In our own data, as well as the data of others, what I've been seeing is a lot of fear, a lot of uncertainty and the sort of common in people turning more conservative, people being more [and I mean, that in the sense of the sort of terror management circle the wagons] being concerned with your own in group and less concerned with the welfare of others. It's a sort of natural tendency when people have scarce resources or feel afraid and see more of that which in some ways does come out politically. And another, maybe connected place where we're seeing some potential negative longer term effects are in people's willingness or ability to trust in science. Sometimes I think that we may have lost a couple thousand years of human progress in the way that the misinformation and lack of information and lack of respect for scientific ways of knowing have been brought about as a result of this pandemic and the polarization of it. And so that's something that I am actually quite concerned about, as are many other people.",0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1

It is this suspicion of science and the suspicion of data, that we have strong ways of understanding this epidemic that have really been undermined in the United States by, kind of this suspicion that pandemics elicit that's very worrisome, is those three things, but I think that there's a lot of progress that will be made out of that.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
Environmental History,,Dagomar Degroot,Degroot," I want to begin my comments by saying that the biggest challenge of this kind of work, of predicting the future is always separating your personal hopes, fears, biases, beliefs, from your professional judgment. Right? And, of course, these questions are very big. They are emotionally charged in many ways. So my responses are informed by my professional judgment as a historian who studied times of severe societal stress, environmental stress, but I'm sure they're also informed by everything else. That's part of me that I bring to the table. So I want to begin by emphasizing that of course. It's not this is not just me speaking as a historian, this is me speaking as a person with many different aspects, I suppose. And with, you know, skin in the game, obviously, as well, which is of course what we all have. Alright, so, let me go through these questions. ","So here, I would say that we're only halfway through the first wave of the pandemic. And so it's very difficult to know, you know, when the pandemic ends and where we'll be when it ends, but from the perspective of being halfway through this first wave, at least here in the United States, one thing that strikes me as being very positive is that the political fortunes of the populace, and I would say of populism and isolationism more broadly, kind of coming apart. It's weakening. Because a pandemic is international by nature. The institutions that helped to combat it and to prevent a pandemic tend to be multilateral and even within countries, it's very difficult as we've seen here in the United States to confront pandemics amid widespread political polarization and amid broader distrust in government and expertise, which is of course associated with populism. And so partly for those reasons I think we are seeing the political fortunes of, obviously the likes of Donald Trump, but also, populists elsewhere in the world that have been hard hit, Mexico, for example, Brazil, we see the political fortunes of some of these populace decline. Now, it's entirely possible that come the second wave, come the fall from the spring, that could all change and history suggests that in some political and social contexts, the fortunes of those who appeal to our basest instincts they seem to rise when there's a period of profound crisis. So the book is not out on this yet, but right now, that is, I think, a hopeful message. ","So this is very difficult, I think, to answer again, in part because we're halfway through that first wave. And in part because there's many different ways of, of answering it, many different areas that are being adversely affected in arms, in our societies, that might rise or fall in importance over the next few months. But for me right now, what I would flag would be shortcomings and the capabilities and the prestige of democracies. So this is a geopolitical point, but it's also a point related to domestic politics. The example of the United States faltering right now is so profound, and will be so profound for people around the world that I think it is contributing to a change in the balance of power between the United States and China, but also in perception of the competence of democracies and authoritarian states, which actually has nothing to do with how competent democracies have been in the face of this crisis versus authoritarian states. There’s democracies, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, New Zealand, the list goes on that have functioned very well, and there are authoritarian states, arguably China, Russia, for example, Turkey, Iran, that have not, I think this is important because we are spending so much capital and creating so much debt and delaying so many important priority areas, including work, to confront climate change and ecological problems, although that might be part of whatever stimulus comes out of this in many societies. We might be looking at is long term degradation in what we're capable of doing in democratic societies that might not exist to the same extent in authoritarian states and particularly in China, which is, of course, the most important, authoritarian state.

"Psychobiology, Epidemiology",,Daisy Fancourt,Fancourt,,"I'm hoping that we're going to see a lot more community engagement from individuals after this pandemic. Early on in the process, we saw a lot of people joining mutual aid groups or other kinds of voluntary associations, people helping their neighbors offering to go and get food or medications for them, people actually started to speak much more to those people who live around them. And I think this is an opportunity for us to build on as we move beyond this pandemic. ","In the UK, we've certainly started to see less and less trust of the government and people really not actually placing as much confidence in the rules they're coming up with and statements they're making. And this has consequences beyond the pandemic, as well as. We might start to have less respect for that institution.

Judgment & Decision-making,Social Psychology,David Dunning,Dunning,,"I think some people, and a lot of kids, are being exposed to how you think about information? How do you think about data? How do you think about evidence, and more to the point, how do you do it in a scientific way? What does science look like? What does gaining information or knowledge in a completely new situation, where there's tremendous uncertainty, and where the story may change from week to week as we learn more, a lot of people are going to be exposed to that. I imagine much like a lot of my generation went into science because of Sputnik, a lot of people are going to go into health and science because of this situation.","A negative consequence of the pandemic is all this media we're being shown, that shows us people not on their best behavior. It shows conflict. And remember that conflict is highlighted on the internet, because well, conflict attracts eyeballs. People who do drama have known this since the Greeks. What also attracts eyeballs is incredibly outrageous behavior. I don't know how many videos I've seen of people massively upset because you've been asked to wear masks in the local supermarket. They're outrageous. They can make you angry. But they could also give you a tilted view of what's really going on with people, what people are really doing. You may focus on the person not wearing the mask and being upset, but you may not notice all the other people in the store wearing the mask that they've been asked to wear. So one of the negative things that we have to be cautious of is not letting, or being shown, about what's going on in the world, to mislead us about how people behave, we can become cynics when a lot of people are acting in a very non cynical, very cooperative way.

Forecasting,,David Passig ,Passig,,"Well, it's it's very hard to do is such a prediction at this very early stage of the pandemic. Most of the people think this is the end of the pandemic, in about a couple months, we're going to have a vaccine or something like that. But actually, we are just at the very initial stage of a very long crisis that might take between three to five years. But we know from previous kind of pandemics, that at the beginning, people tend to lose confidence in their leaders, they tend to be very aggressive towards other groups. And they tend to be melancholic about almost anything in their surrounding. But about 5 to 10 years after such a crisis, we know that people regain confidence, they are trying to restart the new thinking about their social paradigms.One of those consequences is that people will be much attentive to understand how connected we are as a species.They will understand how we are in a kind of symbiosis with each other, we are not just, you know, affiliated. Those kind of terms, affiliation, be part of a group or sharing will be probably old terms of understanding how we connect with each other. Our connections are much, much deeper, they go through very deep layers of existence and that consciousness will be a much more spread across very different kinds of social groups, etc, etc. So, this is what I can say at this point. ","In the short term, which is in the next 5-10 years, we're going to see hate crimes skyrocketing. We are going to see unusual leadership that is going to take over a democracy.We're going to see leaders that are self-confident, that they will be able to do things that others are not able to do and we're going to see some characters that are going to be very colorful in the leadership area worldwide in different places, specifically in democracies.",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1
Business & Leadership,,David Rooney,Rooney,,"Yeah, I mean, that's a really interesting question. And it's one that's caught my interest right from the start of the pandemic. And because, you know, I'm a business school prof, I'm really interested in what happens in the workplace. And with social distancing, and people working from home and working, you know, in virtual teams, or whatever it is. And what I'm seeing here in Australia is that for a decade or more now, workplaces have been very reluctant to allow people not to work from home. But we've seen so many positives coming from it, that it seems like that natural resistance that managers have - to allowing people not to come into the office to work, has finally kind of worn down. And so, there's much more openness about doing that. And I like it for a number of reasons. One is that we know that psychological outcomes in workplaces at the moment, around the world, are not very good. And we see anxiety, depression, mood disorders, generally, as really high-level characteristics of workplaces and the toxicity that we see in the workplace these days, which comes from hyper competitiveness, and neoliberal economic ideology, and so on. And so I think, in the long term, having kind of broken that, that umbilical cord that sees managers and business leaders wanting people to be stuck forever, and in the workplace at their desk, so that they can be controlled and observed, and all of that sort of stuff... is finally perhaps going to be a thing of the past. And that's got to be a good outcome for people's general mental health. But also, it helps people, you know. We all have busy lives, we're dealing with, with career and family and our social life and having that additional flexibility so that we're not spending, you know, let's say up to four hours a day commuting, has got to be a good thing. [So I'd say. But I'd say the one significant downside to that is is the potential for social isolation. So I think that that that's a fairly brief answer to that problem. Or to that to your question, and I think it's actually a really good outcome that we've seen.] ","I'm going to focus here on anxiety. And I think this is a big issue for us. Because you know, with we live in a world, we have lived in a world, where we have unlimited amounts of data, unlimited amounts of information, and our capacity of crave knowledge is unprecedented in human history. So we're kind of used to knowing everything. So we're used to certainty. And we've become the kind of lazy and inexpert coping with ambiguity. And so I think there are some real questions about anxiety. And John F. Kennedy said, in the midst of the Cold War, you know, the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. And, you know, I think some of the, some of the negative behavior we're seeing in relation to people dealing with COVID is ultimately links back to: ""Oh hell, you know, we've got this pandemic, we don't really know how to deal with pandemics. We're afraid. We don't understand this virus, the science is not in on it yet. What the hell do we do? We're not in control of this."" So there's a big set of questions there about fear of fear itself for me. this extends beyond the workplace into our daily lives. And if I'm looking at some of the aberrant decision making that is going on in political leadership around the world, where we're seeing prime ministers, presidents, who just not grasping with the problems that are in front of us, I see a certain level of anxiety in those people as well. And that then leads to poor decision making, or unwise decision making as you and I might think about it. And I guess, if we scale that up to a social level, I think one of the problems we're already seeing, but which I think is going to get worse as we progress, is the falling apart of social cohesion. And you know, we're seeing that in the US in particular. And we've seen identity politics rise and it whole ingroup outgroup dynamic rise. There are people now who are sort of pigeon-holing research knowledge as something that people on the left of politics believe. And charismatic narcissism is something that conservative people believe in, and nothing good can come from that. I mean, this is an unwise society written very broadly in the sky, and I think it's actually very dangerous. And we've seen an erosion of the fundamental democratic values. I do see that as very serious and you know, in the way it links to populist, charismatic narcissistic leaders, whose position in politics is really based in  dividing people and, you know, what they call in politics ""dog whistle politics,"" where you inflame people's fear of the unknown, or fear of the other, the fear of different groups in society that have different points of view. And I think it's something that we just desperately have to acknowledge. And then get on with dealing with, so I think that  that's, this is kind of, I think, where I feel particularly worried, going forward, and where I feel particularly concerned that we need, we need to change the conversation and say that wisdom is not just an individual level phenomenon, it's also a group or a community or a society, a society-wide phenomenon. [And those of us who are interested in this area need to start putting our heads together and coming up with solutions and putting them out there in the public as well as in the scholarly literature through venues like yours. So you know, the online wisdom, podcast, I think, is just a terrific thing. And you know, I really want to congratulate you and Charles on doing this. It's really marvelous. And I think we need it and we need to make these kinds of discussion, the sorts of things that people talk about over breakfast.] ",0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1

Americans and Canadians will probably get over the border between us. But people from strange exotic places are going to experience more prejudice by people from other places. And so I think there's going to be more ethnocentrism, not necessarily ethnic, but kind of, geocentric, there's going to be more geocentrism.

And what we're missing is our ability to really connect with other people in our social world, in a face- to-face way. Sure, most of us are quarantining in place, perhaps with a spouse, perhaps with a friend, with our children. So you're getting some of that face-to-face contact. But what we're missing is our contact with these other people. And I think we're discovering that those contacts are also important for our lives. Certainly close relationships are important and those of us who studied them, sometimes overemphasize the importance of close relationships. But other connections we have are also important; our connections with our co-workers, our associates, the person in your poker group, or your reading group, people you see it health club, even maybe the person who cuts your hair, and we're missing those kind of connections. And I think that what this pandemic is really teaching us is just how important those connections really are.","The most negative change that I've observed during this pandemic is a loss of faith and trust in the institutions and governments and organizations in our lives. When this all started we were all looking to the news media, to the CDC, to our governments to give us guidance about how to get through this safely. And over time, the kind of chaotic reaction that we've had has eroded that trust. So right now, lots of people don't trust the CDC, they certainly don't trust the president. They perhaps don't trust the governor. They don't trust the mayors in their community. And certainly, it's not just the pandemic that has done this. The various other crises that have happened in the last few months have contributed to that as well. But our trust in institutions and even our trust in our neighbors has eroded to the point where people don't know who or what to believe. And to be sure, those institutions are responsible for some of this. The CDC has given very mixed guidance, some of their guidance has not been useful. The president has suggested things that were downright nonsensical and even dangerous. And you look at some other countries, so I'm really struck by New Zealand the government there immediately did a complete and total shutdown. Six weeks after that, there's no Coronavirus in New Zealand, it's gone. It's completely gone and their society is opening up again. Meanwhile, we're three or four months into this having record numbers of new cases. It's so totally natural to not have faith in our institutions when they've been doing such a terrible job of giving us guidance to get through this. And it's going to be difficult and time consuming for us to get out of that.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Cognitive Psychology,Wisdom,Howard Nusbaum,Nusbaum,,"The most positive social psychological change that will last after the end of the pandemic, is likely to be the ability to make a real and meaningful social connection at a distance. That is, using the kind of tools we're using now to actually feel connected to somebody. I can see my colleagues doing things like having a toast over zoom now, actually doing this to welcome a new faculty member and beyond, my daughter's playing games with groups online, this way, or with zoom, and so forth. This will be a skill, it's been debatable for a long time, whether people in online settings are really making social contact and feeling social connection. One of the things we're learning is the skill of how to do that in these current circumstances. And that means that long distance friendships and relationships can be bolstered, more easily at the end of the pandemic.","I think it's the complement of what I was just saying that is, as people become more socially distanced and isolated, they may lose some of the skills of face-to-face interaction. They may start to become more in their own heads, and less adept at connecting to other people. There’s a risk, at least for some people in society, we're not making use of these tools or not connecting effectively with these tools, to basically withdraw within themselves and lose the sense of that social connection. We've become at risk for greater social isolation and not physical social isolation. But as Cacioppo talked about it, this sort of increasing negative construal about our social interactions so that we feel bad and become worse off as a function of those social connections.",1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1

Emotions,Clinical Psychology,James Gross,Gross,,"One of the things that pandemic has done is to really shake up our patterns of work, social interaction, and leisure. Often, these are painful and difficult changes. But out of this chaos, and this alteration in our habitual modes of existence, and in these different domains, I think there are opportunities for really re-evaluating what gives us joy and meaning in our lives. And if we are able to take stock in what we've found has changed, that's actually led to greater sense of meaning and joy, I think there's opportunity for gain at the individual level. At a societal level, too, I think there are opportunities for benefit. In one place that we might see benefit, or something positive coming from this very difficult time is an appreciation, greater appreciation of the need for collaboration at transnational levels. This has always been a tension between the national and the transnational ever since the innovation of the nation state. And it's been very difficult for us to remember the importance of collaborative activity across nations and across cultures. And I think this is an opportunity to see that there are threats, many threats that we face as a species that really are best addressed at this collective level.  ","I think the unifying theme there is probably the growing inequity. We are, as is well understood, are experiencing growing inequity in distribution of resources, across nations and cultures, and certainly within any given nation. And that represents, I think, a tremendous source of suffering, because so much of our sense of wellbeing derives from a comparison of how we're doing to how others are doing. And the greater the inequity, the greater the suffering.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Social Psychology,,Jean Twenge,Twenge,,"One of the most positive changes is something we're already seeing, which is in political activism. That, maybe, this might be the end of apathy. Maybe we'll get better voter turnout. Assuming we can find a way to do that safely. That we have more people who are going to  volunteer to work for a campaign. We’ve already seen a big protests for racial justice, a lot of movement around reform around police brutality and so on, that there's just more interest in the civic sphere and in getting involved, and changing government and public policies and so on.","The most negative thing that's happening right now is around mental health. And I have a paper out on that, that’s a preprint, and there's several other studies, one I just saw today, from those who administer the General Social Survey, they sample in May, looking at happiness and happiness is at a 50 year low. And we find in our paper, big increases in mental distress. There's census data, US Census Bureau administer data, looking at anxiety and depression that is also increased by quite a bit during the pandemic. I think it's really clear that we have a mental health crisis on our hands. So we have to keep that in mind, that that's real. That yes, you know, sometimes you're gonna have great examples of resilience and there are a lot of positives, but that for a significant number of people looks like it's up to a third of people, there's some pretty serious mental distress, anxiety and depression going on, probably from the social isolation, from the anxiety around possibly catching the illness, and, of course around economic disruptions, which don't look like they're going away anytime soon.

Cognitive Psychology,Neuroscience,Jeffrey Zacks,Zacks,,"I think one thing the pandemic has done is broken some habits. One of those that's striking to me is business travel. Lots of us had all these trips scheduled in February and March that just disappeared. And this is no doubt induce some social and collaboration costs, but also has had real benefits for families and for the environment, reducing our carbon footprint. And I think we should take advantage of that lesson. ","I'd start by saying that I think the big obvious negative consequences are social and psychopathological. And these are not to be neglected. But they're also not so much an area that I have expertise in. One issue, which I don't think is as important, but I think is pretty interesting and is of some importance concerns episodic memory. And the issue here is that we know that differentiating context is super important for burning in effective, episodic and autobiographical memories. And our normal existence offers a bunch of contextual cues that have been eliminated by living on zoom. So, in my normal life, I might teach a class and then walk from one physical location to another and have a meeting, and then ride my bike across town for a lunch or another meeting. Now, I go from zoom meeting to zoom meeting, as do we all. And lots of folks have told me that they feel like one event just blends into the other, blends in together in their memory. And I worry that we may wind up with a kind of collective fog in our memories for these couple of years. ",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
Emotions,Judgment & Decision-making,Jennifer Lerner,Lerner,,"Sociologists, political scientists, behavioral scientists have recently written about the decline of social capital. And probably the most famous book on this is Bob Putnam's book ""Bowling Alone."" And, in a sense, in recent decades we've become a kind of hyper individualistic society, in the United States, even more so than we've ever been. Where, we listen to our own music, we individualize everything, and even when we're on public transportation, we're tuned in for our own podcasts, our own music, etc. So there has been this real decline in social capital, where we don't know our neighbors as much, we're not in clubs with them, we're not in bowling leagues. And so I think a positive benefit that is coming already, and will, I hope, continue out of the pandemic, is the recognition of how valuable community is. As the basic building block of social capital, many people are now learning who their neighbors are, even though they didn't know their neighbors before, because we've discovered that we need them. And people who are in many different social clubs, social support groups, community organizations are doing better in this pandemic, because they are receiving help. There are neighbors delivering groceries to elderly people, or people with chronic disease, that sort of thing. We're learning that this kind of maximalist individualism isn't necessarily the best way to be. That, in fact, we are better when we live within rich layers of community and social networks. ","This is a really hard question for me, because I think that there are so many significant negative aspects. Being the mother of a teenager, I can see how disillusioning it is for children to see the mishandling by government of this crisis. And I think that will have lasting effects. If we handle it the right way, as parents and in schools, this can be an energizing experience for a lot of young people, but I think it also will have lasting wounds of divisiveness, and disillusionment. I think we need to really work hard, ideally with a new administration, to help people believe again in government. That the people we vote for actually will represent us, keep us safe, not tell lies. And that's one of I think, the most negative devastating effects of this pandemic. I think probably the most devastating effect is the deaths and disease and suffering. Because, you know, there's nothing worse than that. And so I don't want to leave that unnoticed. Then in terms of other social aspects, I think the pandemic has been a great amplifier of existing fault lines. And so the divisions between rich and poor, between elites and non-elites has really been amplified. So, there are people like me, who get to work at home in the comfort of my WiFi-enabled house, and then there are people who have lost their livelihoods, because they were in the service sector, and those services are no longer being offered during the pandemic. Or a variety of other kinds of jobs that have gone by the wayside during the pandemic. And then, of course, differences in access to healthcare. And then the inherent biases within the healthcare system mean that African-American individuals have been dying at much higher rates than they should be relative to their representation within the population. So, a really frightening amplifier of our fault lines, of our weaknesses in society, that I can only hope that those of us who are in a position to take note of and make changes on will, that this will ultimately catalyze change.

Clinical Psychology,,Katie McLaughlin,McLaughlin,,"these kinds of mass community stressors, or even traumatic events provide this opportunity for us to come together as communities. And one of the positive things that we've seen is this sort of enormous outpouring of behaviors that reflect help, helping behaviors towards one another in our communities. So, you know, at the beginning of the pandemic, you saw high school students playing musical instruments for residents of nursing homes who were isolated. And you see people of the communities who have a more advantage, who have more financial resources, giving to those in their communities who don't, people taking meals to older neighbors who are unable to go to the grocery store, to leave their houses as readily, because they're more vulnerable. And something that we know from psychological research says that in moments of stress when we give to others in our communities, when we help, those behaviors actually have a stress-buffering effect for those who are helping. So, they're not only positive for the people who receive the help. But giving of ourselves to others actually provides a stress buffering effect that prevents some of the negative health consequences of experiencing stress for those who are doing the helping. And so I think this is an opportunity for us to become more engaged with our communities and more committed to supporting and helping one another.
","Here, I would say, the mental health consequences of the pandemic are where I, you know, see the biggest potential for lasting negative effects. So, we know that exposure to stress is among the most powerful determinants of mental health problems like depression, anxiety, increases in substance use. And the pandemic has introduced innumerable stressors into the lives of everyone, whether it's changes in work, changes in children's ability to go to school, worries for the future, worries about our health and ability to access goods and services that we routinely engage in, and many, many, many others. And what we know is that work on resilience, such as the work of George Bonanno, has shown that even after very extreme traumatic stressors, many people do just fine. They exhibit resilience, about half of people across lots of different studies, even in the face of very extreme forms of stress. You know, their mental health and functioning remain high throughout. For the rest of people, we see about half of them so maybe 25%, maybe one third of people will experience a transient increase and symptoms like depression and anxiety that that go away over time. And that pattern is likely what we'll see here as well. But we also see that a smaller proportion of people anywhere from 15 to 30%, depending on the study experience increases in mental health problems like depression and anxiety that are going to persist over time, that may become more chronic. And that's really the group that I think we need to be thinking about in terms of interventions and ways of supporting those who have been more impacted in terms of mental health, with effects that could last well beyond when the pandemic ends.

Psychology & Aging,Motivation,Laura Carstensen,Carstensen,,"My hope is that one positive change that can come about because of the pandemic is that people will be better able to challenge and see some of the tacit assumptions that they make about life. The certainty with which we predict that our lives will remain stable, the certainty that we will have health and financial security and contact with our loved ones. And by recognizing the fragility of these aspects of our lives, they will come to have greater importance and greater value.","I fear that the pandemic has the potential to raise the sense of alienation from others and even a sense of fear of others.

Social Psychology,Political Science,Leaf Van Boven,VanBoven,,"The pandemic is obviously hugely disruptive. One of the things we know is that creates a sense of uncertainty and tentativeness and questioning about the way things work. Many people are asking what is it about the way our society works or the way my life works, that is working or not working. And that's not inherently positive, except that it sets up a frame of mind that makes it easier to change habits because we start to ask ourselves what should be different. Hopefully, we have the wisdom and the insight to recognize things like social relationships are important, and we want more of those. That many pointless meetings are not so valuable, and we want fewer of those. I think that there's an opportunity for positive change that needs to happen with some guidance. And when I say guidance, I really mean the kind of introspection and reflection that people can engage in about what are the important values. Hopefully that happens naturally. I think as psychologists and social behavioral scientists, we can help frame that question, help people think through the answers to those questions.","It stems from the same source of tentativeness and uncertainty. We're all asking what comes next? What does this mean for the way our society is structured? Those are difficult questions. And who poses the answers to those questions? Is it the case that autocratic leaders might answer those questions for us, might give us an easy answer where the answer is essentially, it's because of them, it's because of the out group. We know that people can be really easily pulled into these kinds of intergroup conflicts. Given that we're in this moment of uncertainty and tentativeness, will we allow other people provide us with an easy answer that really steers us toward the negative. And it's a very tempting psychological path to go down because it means blaming other people and not really confronting the difficult challenges in our own lives or in our own societies.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
Emotions,Neuroscience,Lisa Feldman Barrett,FeldmanBarrett,,"I would say that as a scientist, one thing we know is that the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. So, when you look at past epidemics, you can see that in a crisis like this, like the flu epidemic and others, similar, Spanish flu epidemic and at the turn of the century and other epidemics, one aspect of social life that did in some ways get better, was the stratification of society and to some extent, some forms of racism. So one thing that crises do like this is they kind of reveal the cracks in a society. And I think we saw this with just in recent weeks with the reaction to the George Floyd murder and the Black Lives movement, in the United States and in Canada, and in lots of countries around the world, so one possibility is that people will take action, they'll realize that one of our greatest strengths as a species is that we are social animals. And that means that we are necessary to each other's well-being. And so hopefully, now that these cracks have been revealed, many of us have known they've been there for a long time. We'll have the opportunity to do something about them.","It would probably be the same kind of thing in the sense when I said that if you look back to previous epidemics, you can see that there have been efforts that make things a little bit more egalitarian in certain ways where social stratification is reduced in certain ways. But there's also evidence that it goes the other way, that people become more entrenched in their in-group and out-group beliefs. And there's an opportunity, unfortunately, for increased racism in certain cases. In each case, when there’s been a large health crisis it's certain groups that benefit and other groups don't, what I mean by that is certain out-groups benefit and they do better actually, the minority culture broadens to include them more, but there are always out-groups that suffer more too. And I think that's a real danger here.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Evolutionary Psychology,Social Psychology,Mark Schaller,Schaller,,"For a lot of people in many parts of the world, particularly those of us who live in these relatively wealthy, modernized parts of the world, the threat posed by infectious diseases has kind of been off our radar, and this pandemic has changed that and as a result that's offered an opportunity at a massive worldwide scale to have increased awareness of, and education about the challenges that infectious diseases pose to people and pose to a way of life that we take for granted. This is maybe even more important, a means through which these challenges can be met. So it's really been an unprecedented learning opportunity. I think particularly to learn about how this is kind of weird and invisible force of nature can be mitigated through the coordinated combination of sensible thoughtful responses by individuals, by communities, by the folks who are entrusted to govern these communities. And these lessons, if in fact, we do learn them, can serve individuals and societies as we face additional challenges in the future.","The real negative consequence is that a hell of a lot of people have died and a hell of a lot of people are bereaved, and a hell of a lot of people are experiencing a lasting hit on their health and well-being. And it's a massive tragedy. People may be inclined to be more interpersonally wary of other people, even when the pandemic’s over and there isn't that increased risk of infection. People may still act as though there is. For the past several months, we have erected barriers between ourselves and other people. Some of those barriers are behavioral, there are restrictions, some self-imposed, some imposed by others, on who we interact with and how we interact with them. And some of these barriers are physical barriers, like these plexiglass shields that you see in grocery stores now. And I assume that over time, some of these barriers will dissolve. And, certainly the informal ones are likely to dissolve, I'm certainly looking forward to touching, hugging my friends again. But I'm guessing that some of these barriers are going to stick around for a while, and there'll be these consistent, persistent reminders of the pandemic. And that's perfectly sensible from an epidemiological perspective, but it's kind of a drag for interpersonal interaction. And so my concern is that there's going to be this persistent, lasting wariness of interactions with other people, especially strangers. that represents a low level erosion of interpersonal trust and erosion of social capital.

Social Psychology,,Melody Chao,Chao,,"What we observe is that people have started reaching out to family and friends that they have not been in touch with for a long time. And so people might feel a stronger sense of connectedness. This observation is also consistent with some recent research findings showing that compared with before the pandemic, people during this pandemic actually feel more connected with the community. They also found that a stronger sense of community is associated with the ability to buffer them against experience of the stress. During the early stage of the pandemic, there were concerned that people might feel more isolated, they feel lonelier as a result of social distancing and social isolation. What some study have shown is that people actually acquire resilience during this pandemic, psychologically, and there were no drastic change in terms of people's experience of loneliness. If anything, people have a stronger sense of community connectedness with other people. That would be the potential positive change in terms of interpersonal domain. In terms of work domain, one observation is that in the past, usually we relied a lot on routine. And routines are something that are often unquestioned and unquestionable. People are just doing what they're doing, because that's how things have been; that's how things are like. We don't really ask questions about that. But with a pandemic, and with the change in work mode, people started asking questions like, is this essential? Is this necessary? Is this really a must? Is this travel a requirement? Do we have to travel to get this work done? People started asking questions that they might not have even considered asking before. And it helps to streamline some work processes. And some people actually found that to be more efficient in helping them to finish to get the work done. ","The most salient one is about the possibility that this pandemic is actually exaggerating initial inequality in a community. We talk about positive changes that in order to benefit from the positive change, people need to be able to adapt and adjust very quickly to the changing situations, to the changing requirement of work or school. And in order to adapt and adjust what would be needed? It would be access to resources. So, if you have more resources, you might be better able to adjust and adapt. But if you have limited resources, it makes it difficult. For example, from the standpoint of schools, when the children can no longer attend school in person, some schools that have more resources are able to adjust and change very quickly they started offering classes online, whereas for other schools, they might not have the technical support and resources to do that to offer classes online. Then what happens to the students? And even if the school were able to offer online classes, are the children able to attend those online classes? It depends on the amount to current resources that they have access to. And adding to the complexity is that when parents no longer have work, or they might be working from home, this all tie into access to resources. People are talking about how this pandemic is exaggerating the initial inequality that the societies have. Whereas people who have more resources are more able in adapting to the changes, and people who have limited resources would be disadvantaged further, because of this rapid change. In addition to that, other layers of negative impact can also be psychological. Though we talk about positive change where people have a stronger sense of community, at the same time, we also see that there are people experiencing distress.",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1
Social Psychology,Cultural Psychology,Michael Bond,Bond,"people talk about the end of the pandemic and indeed one of your questions. What are you gonna do when it's over? Well, that presumes it's going to be over. And of course we all hope it's going to be over but who knows for sure. And, and if it's over, if it is over we need to realize I think that it it. It may not end just the same way Ebola has not ended. It's ended for some of us as a daily consideration and concern on the news. COVID May, and for some of us as a daily concern, but of course one of the issues one of the negative consequences that you have asked about regarding COVID of course, is that it knocks out the health delivery systems and the social support institutions. In less wealthy countries, and these are strangers in a strange land, who may not gather our empathy, attention, and then efficent as a species, that's one of the negative consequences, I think, psychologically and politically that emerge for me. possible consequences out of COVID-19 that will close the borders, hunker down take care of local business without realizing that all COVID business is international. whether we know it or not. And of course, we knowing it is maybe a presumption on my heavily informed Intellectual academic perspective on the situation. And surely if we've learned anything from American politics in the last three years is that it's very difficult to understand the full range of variable political social attitudes that people hold and hold to them strongly. Any holding strongly. And of course, it's the strength of this holding attitudes. That's a very important variable to consider, as we anticipate the future. When existential crisis are involved, I think people batten down the hatches as they used to say, in the Navy when they were hunkering through a star Tempest at sea and and become very insular, insulated, focused upon narrow Survival concerns whether we will emerge as ever. However, we emerge from COVID with a heightened sense of our international connectedness, indeed, even our social  connectedness interpersonal connectedness, that's another issue that's been highlighted and could be a negative consequence of our response to the experience of passing through COVID. There was a quote in The Guardian from somebody being interviewed, saying, your risk isn't my risk. Signaling, I think, that part of what people hope others will realize is that you can be taking a risk. That's your business, but it's no longer just your business, because you're taking a risk implicates me, I can involve me. If if you're not careful, and if you're reckless, then you can be taking me down as you go about your business willy nilly in this rather sociopathic way that many people have. ","Positive size societal change would be a redirection of social wealth through progressive taxation and that would channel itself into social institutions like employee protection, job retraining, health care and pollution control, welfare services, educational access, technical training for the fourth industrial revolution and guaranteed income, yielding greater freedom from disease, crime and natural disaster. The important psychological outcome for me would be a heightened awareness or common fate, and our ecological vulnerability. We've seen that vulnerability, of course, as we respond to the virus itself. There's a much wider consideration to make when we talk about ecological vulnerability, particularly, the climate crisis and pollution mechanisms that interfere with the basic human functioning, willingness to sacrifice our wealth and freedoms for the welfare of others. So that your risks should not be my risk locally, nationally and internationally. But that would require a willingness on everybody's part to exercise their freedoms within constraint, their wealth within beneficence, you might say, more broadly than presently defined. That should occur of course, psychologically, but would have to be reinforced societally.","Again, two parts, and I'll start with societal. My major concern about negative change is a reduced commitment on the part of all nations, particularly the more advantaged nations to international institutions. The other is wars promoted by groups who are exploiting weakened military and legal resistance that internal political systems create, potentiating the possibility for internal political violence,  which we know from the work of Rummel, Richard Rummel is a far greater promoter of homicide, what he calls democide, then are actual wars between nations. The additional feature about wars that can be potentiated is that there's going to be greater third party indifference and preoccupation so that you don't get the mediating roles being played to the same extent as nations who normally might step up for this mediation role, are preoccupied with dealing with the COVID and their own economic collapse. And we haven't seen the worst of it yet. I keep thinking of the quote from Plato, ""only the dead have seen the end of war"". Well, the likelihood of being dead is increasing as a consequence of COVID not only as a consequence of the illness itself, the virus, but also the ancillary destruction of other institutions, locally, including the health delivery system, where many people are denied access to that system have problems other than COVID-19. Psychological negative responses: heightened nationalism, skepticism about the efficacy of science, and the rise in what you would call virulent fundamentalism or authoritarianism. Cynicism and a sense of despair are certainly growing in some quarters. Not all, because some people, of course, are more resilient than others. But a sense of cynicism knows no personality, very few personality loadings and is a consequence of your understanding of how the world works. And if we get cynical about how the world works, it's really going to turn off our willingness as individuals to reengage.",0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
Consumer Behavior,Social Psychology,Michael Norton ,Norton,,"One of the things that I think the pandemic has really highlighted even more than it was already being highlighted is inequality, not just income but in health outcomes. If you look at the people who are most affected by COVID, it's older people, it's people with pre-existing health conditions, it's lower income people, all people who are vulnerable in one way or another. And the pandemic sort of throws that into stark relief, even though we're aware of it, now we can really see how this plays out in the health domain. My hope is that people will see inequality in a different way than they were seeing it before and hopefully be more motivated to do something about it. ","I think this is going to vary a lot by country-to-country and by city-to-city and even by neighborhood to neighborhood. But, the role of trust in everyday life, I think, has taken a big hit. Both trust in big institutions like government and health agencies across the world, but also local trust in your local governments, and even in your neighbors and in your communities. Because we've been so isolated, and because we got hit by such a negative, external blow, it's hard to trust anymore. When things are going so badly, it's hard to know that you could ever trust again a big organization or even the people in your community. So there is, I think, a real worry, that that trust won't rebound a little bit so that we can have some faith in institutions and have some faith in our communities as we move forward. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Cognitive Psychology,Social Psychology,Michael Ross,Ross,,"I can certainly say I don't have a clue but I can make some guesses with fairly low confidence. The two areas that I would think about - and then I'll focus on one-  is inequality and care for older people in long term care homes and nursing homes. Both of which have been exposed during the pandemic. If I had to guess in which area we might get movement, I would say not inequality. I think inequality is a tough nut to crack and I'm not sure we're prepared to deal with it. On the other hand, there's a chance that we'll think more seriously about how we care about the frail elderly and that we will force governments to enact legislation and think about putting more funding into these contexts in order to prevent what should have been a totally foreseeable consequence in terms of the effects of COVID-19 and long term care homes. We shouldn't take for granted that of course, older people are going to die from this because the statistics are hard to come by. But if you look at some statistics that the CDC has put out recently, it shows that the incidence of COVID-19 among 60 to 79 year olds is actually quite a bit lower than it is among 40 to 49 year olds and 50 to 60 year olds. To you and me, that's not a surprise because we wrote a paper that says the same thing with respect to scams. And I think it's a similar answer. If you focus on, the human body and just talk about older people being more vulnerable and having more vulnerable immune systems and having other kinds of diseases that make them more vulnerable, of course, you're going to assume older people are going to be more vulnerable. But if you think about lifestyle, and you realize that older people often don't go to nightclubs and do the kinds of things that might expose them to this virus, older people living in non-institutional settings, can actually do reasonably well. So it's not just a function of age, it is a function of setting. And we have to do something about those settings. And I think there's at least a small chance that we'll do something.","One concern I would have is that the effectiveness of government leaders and of so called experts in the area of infectious disease has been mixed. There have been some locations where they've done splendidly and they're well regarded. But there are lots of other locations in which neither the experts nor the government, that perhaps relies on the experts, have done all that well in predicting outcomes. Don't wear a mask, you don't need to a wear mask, masks aren’t gonna prevent anything and then a complete turnaround. And they express gross views with such incredible confidence. They’re one hundred percent sure masks aren’t effective, wash your hands, don't wear masks. So what I'm worried about is a lack of trust, that we’ll come not to trust both experts and government officials in those provinces, states, countries, where they have frankly screwed up. And it's easy to say hindsight is 2020. And, how could they know? Well, some people did know. And in some states and some provinces, and in some countries, they did anticipate, and they did a lot better. So I think they should be held to account. But I'm worried there'll be a lack of trust, and the consequences of that can be very negative. It can lead to walking away from the political process, not leading to experts, it could lead to a lot of things short of violence and that are negative. Not voting, because what's the point? They're all useless. That's one of the things, again, with low confidence because I don't think you can predict worth a damn. ",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
Cultural Psychology,Organizational behavior,Michele Gelfand,Gelfand,,"I expect that we're going to see an increase in gratitude. When we've been faced with a collective disaster, we really begin to appreciate the small things in life that we've taken for granted. I think we're going to be more grateful for a variety of things, even for things, like eating out going to concerts, being able to hug our friends again, and our loved ones and even for speaking on a crowded subway. In that sense, I think it's going to produce a lot of collective gratitude.","We’re going to need to find a way to forgive, the massive mistakes that we've made and to build trust, at least in the United States, where I'm located, in how we dealt with the pandemic. In the past, in our country, after 9/11, after World War Two, we really stood united. And we were able to sacrifice liberty for new rules, to overcome adversity. And this makes sense that when we experience a collective threat we need to come together. But during COVID-19, we saw a useless partisan conflict, great resistance in different parts of the country to things like wearing masks and social distancing, and we lost lives that could have been prevented. Have we been a stronger, more united culture and I think that we're going to need to really reckon with those mistakes.",0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0
Psychology & Aging,Wisdom,Monika Ardelt,Ardelt,,"One positive note might be that we realize that this kind of pandemics, or these kinds of global events, can only be solved if we work together as a community, as a world community. And that's does not only mean different countries working together, but also working together between rich and poor. So, because we are not safe if only the rich that the vaccines and the poor will not. And in some ways, what I hope what might come out of this is that this might be maybe a practice run for something more dangerous, more dangerous pandemic later, but also for the effect of global warming, quite frankly, because a lot of people say that this is a really existential threat and we all have to work together. So, maybe this is a kind of a practice run to get us all working together, and then using the established connections to work on global warming and maybe other global problems.","Wherever you have the positive side, we're realizing that we have to work together on this to overcome this. The other side of the coin is exactly that we become more self-centered and looking out for number one, and my tribe, which we have be seeing in the United States. You know, these really two tribes fighting each other and not really caring about others or caring about immigrants or caring about people who are poor, or who have no health insurance and all these kinds of things. So, because resources are scarce that means that we're fighting over the resources and just looking out for ourselves and... yeah, our own family, our… the people that think like us, that look like us. And that would be the unfortunate negative outcome if it comes to that.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
Sociology & Biosocial Science,,Nicholas Christakis,Christakis,,"What the pandemic is doing is exploiting some very deep and fundamental aspects of human nature. We humans evolved to live in groups in very particular ways. And in some ways, you could even argue that the spread of germs is the price we pay for the spread of ideas. In other words, I come near you in order to benefit from the opportunity for social learning, and teaching, or we assemble ourselves in groups in order to be able to cooperate, for example, and achieve benefits as a group we couldn't as individuals. And these contagious pathogens have evolved to take into account the kind of network structure that we have, and the kind of social behaviors that we manifest. So if we didn't live socially, there'd be no opportunity for the germ to spread from me to you. These germs that we're facing, the pandemic we're facing right now, is exploiting that and attacking us, if you think about it, at our most fundamental humanity, at the fact that we are living as social animals. And ironically, therefore, in order to combat the pathogen, we have to abandon a whole set of behaviors that ordinarily are very normal to us, like spending time with our friends, or touching each other, consoling each other physically, for example, living socially in general. So we have to spread physically apart. But there are some things that the germ does not take away from us that are equally social and important and that we can use to combat the pathogen. And one of those things is that we can band together, to work together, to stay physically apart, for example. And another example is that we benefit from our capacity for cumulative culture, we benefit from the capacity that we have over millennia acquired information which we transmit about how to deal with pandemics. You don't need to reinvent the wheel, we don't need to needlessly die. Because we're rediscovering how to deal with a deadly germ, we can open up a book, or look online or consult an expert, all of those activities, opening up a book looking online consulting an expert, our social learning, and teaching and that is a key fundamental aspect of our species. What the epidemic is highlighted, the positive things that it's highlighted, is this kind of banding together and helping each other by a teaching. One example of that is also our very capacity to develop drugs and vaccines to develop pharmaceutical interventions to fight this germ, which other animals can’t do. And that's another wonderful quality that we have.","Many people have highlighted things like increasing loneliness, and which is true. And many children being out of school will experience adverse childhood events.  There's an epidemic of this even in the United States right now, of children whose parents get divorced or die, or live in poverty, many of our children are harmed by, unfortunately, even though they live in a rich country like ours, just by being children. And the pandemic has no doubt exacerbated this. It's killing people. It's stressing people out people lose their jobs, they suffer, their children suffer. There is, of course, the lockdown measures have led to an epidemic of loneliness, there's been a rise in intimate partner violence, because people are stuck at home, their police are less able to respond. So there's a lot of bad stuff that has happened as a result of the pandemic. There's no doubt about it. I mean, you have to understand that something very unusual in the life of our species has happened, it happened to have happened in 2020 when we're alive, it happens every 50 or 100 years. It just happens to be happening now, which is that a new serious pathogen is being introduced into our species and this germ SARS CoV-2 is going to circulate among us forever now, and it's going to do what it wants. There's some debate about whether viruses are living, but for the sake of argument, it's acting like a living thing. And it's had an ecological release. We're a wholly susceptible population. It's like releasing rats on an isolated island. And then they just decimate the local wildlife because that's what they do. That's what this germ is going to do. It's just going to move among us. It has its own will to survive, and it's just gonna kill us, until it ends.",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
Risk Governance & Sustainability,,Ortwin Renn,Renn,,"There are three major changes that I can foresee as part of the consequences of the pandemic. Number one is that people feel that our societies are more vulnerable than they thought before. And then we need to invest more in societal resilience. Second, is a belief that a lot of people now have the feeling that much of what they've done in the past, like going to conferences, using a lot of airplanes, or doing a lot of traveling is not really necessary, when you look at the possibilities that virtual reality can actually offer to you, specifically in terms of conferencing services. And number three, I can also see that some people, not all of them, are now questioning our patterns of consumption, that they feel now that things like health and like harmony with family and solidarity are so important, that many of the other things that they have strived for, like more income or more consumption, is not as important for having a happy life. So those are the three major implications that I can see coming from the pandemic. ","Looking into the German situation, I can see that the pandemic has also increased the polarization in society and polarization in two different fields. One is that we have more violations of equity, so that people are very differently affected by the pandemic, and specifically, the poor and the less educated, less skilled, have much more to suffer than the other ones. And secondly, I think that we have seen a polarization in political views that several groups in society feel very much estranged from the political sphere. They may not feel the solidarity, but rather feel that they have been obliged to do things that they don't want to do, and that have radicalized, at least some of the people on the far left or the far right, but also in different other areas of society.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We get very caught up in our own small group, and we are dismissive, or worse, cruel and accusatory towards other groups.

Emotions,Social Psychology,Paula Niedenthal,Niedenthal,,"I'm noticing that during this time, people are sitting with the details of their life, their families, their actual environment, their actual landscape, much more than they have done in the past, on average, and spending less time planning and constructing and anticipating an experience often somewhere else that they could possibly have to gain fulfillment or pleasure. For example, rather than planning a trip abroad that's filled with mishaps and standing in the rain and getting sick and potentially not having a lot of pleasure, but then deriving a lot of pleasure later when people give you social credit for doing that trip or where you can make it seem incredibly interesting. Instead of doing that people are walking to the store or making bread or discovering that the landscape around their home, whether it's urban or rural, is very beautiful. I think a benefit of that is that people continue to recognize the bottom up influences on their psychological well-being and their happiness as much as they recognize that happiness can be derived from social credit and from telling stories later about things that might elicit envy or just other kinds of social credit.","Because of my particular interests and research interests, people have noted a lot to me, what wearing masks over their faces does to them psychologically, and similarly, what working at home alone does to them and what they're referring to is deindividuation. So if you have a mask on your face, you don't really make eye contact with other people because you don't feel visible to them in the first place. Because much of your identity is gone. I pass people on bikes who I don't recognize to be my own neighbors. Our concern would be that these feelings of deindividuation also persist beyond this pandemic, where people are able to navigate in the social world with the feeling that nobody is really identifying them. And the costs that come with deindividuation are things like not feeling responsible for one's particular behavior or being unusually susceptible to social norms. So my concern is that this persists.",0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0
Emotions,Social Psychology,Paula Pietromonaco,Pietromonaco,,"One aspect of social life that is clearly impacted by the current pandemic is couples’ relationships. As a result of quarantines and social distancing, married and cohabiting couples are spending more time in the same space; often, while they're facing significant stress from an array of problems, such as financial losses, changes in their jobs or unemployment, lack of daycare and school closures and the daily stress of falling precautions to avoid contracting the virus. Some couples may be resilient in the face of these significant stressors and benefit from the opportunity to spend more time together, to work together, to solve problems, and to support each other. And by facing adversity together, their relationships may become even stronger in the long term. We know from a large body of research, that having supportive, well-functioning close relationships is closely tied to better emotional and physical health. And so an additional positive impact is that couples who are able to be resilient over time also may do better in terms of their health, and general wellbeing.","I just suggested that some couples will capitalize on opportunities for growth in their relationships. But these are likely to be couples who are not particularly economically or socially vulnerable. We know from many research studies that when people are faced with stress that comes from outside the relationship, such as financial or job stress, they're more likely to interact with their partner in ways that are potentially damaging to the relationship. They're more likely to be overly critical, or argue, to blame their partner to find it harder to listen to their partner's concerns and understand their partner's perspective. And over time, they may become less satisfied with their relationship and may even break up. So couples who are most vulnerable, those facing the most severe economic hardship, also may suffer the most damage to their relationships over the long term. ",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
Judgment & Decision-making,,Ralph Hertwig,Hertwig,"these are terrible questions, by the way. They are unanswerable. I mean, that there are so many things to be said about them, including predictions are always wrong. There is no that there's nothing just positive or everything that looks positive as negative, undesirable consequences. It's just there are so many layers to bet that one doesn't get to, to express. ","Well, let me first say that, as we all know, predictions are hard, especially when they are about the future. And another important insight that we should keep in mind is that nothing is per se, only positive or only negative. A lot of these things have unintended consequences, and they can be negative and positive. So, in answering your question, I think what the pandemic will do, it will work as a catalyst for a stronger digitalization, the impact of digital technologies on our life. And that is, in my view, going to have major consequences, of which I hope most are positive. It will affect the way we educated. It will affect the way we live, where we live, in cities or on the countryside. It will affect the way we work, our working hours, it will affect the way we shop, it will affect the way we interact with each other. These are going to be major changes. That will be my prediction. ","I think, unfortunately, the most notable difference that I fear is going to occur is an increase in inequality. I think that as a consequence of this pandemic, certain jobs will disappear. The importance of education will increase and some people in the way we educate now will be left behind.

Social Psychology,Cultural Psychology,Richard Nisbett,Nisbett,,"The only one that I feel qualified to speculate about is the academic impact, tele-academics that we're going to be having as an option. And there are positive and negative aspects, but the positive aspects. If you've got a class 75 people, the same two people raise their hand all the time. If you have got, everybody lined up and they say they can raise their hand without actually moving their hand, they just push a button and he can decide who to call on. So mix it up a bit, it isn't just the same two people with the shortest latency. Some higher education people are going to see advantages to that. And we’ll be inclined to use it I’m sure for lots of circumstances. Then at the elementary level, and probably also at secondary level as well, but certainly the elementary level, some children are saying now, I like this zoom education so much better than being in class, there’s not the chaos that you have in class, there’s not the jerks. At least for some kids, for some kinds of education, it's going to be a plus.","It’s internet education. There is something that goes on in a real classroom, that's superior, to what you can get, it's an immediacy, a clear reading of body language and facial expressions and so on, that gets lost. I worry that people will be using the internet education automatically without seriously thinking about it, which would be a big problem. The thing I most fear is that people will, if they have the option to get, their higher degree of BA be online for a very low price that many people will take it, who should not? Certainly if there's no way for you to get a really super college education, except through online means that's one thing. But if you are the sort of person who could afford to pay for college education or who could expect to get a scholarship for college education, then it's a huge loss not to do that. Your fellow students are as important as education, at any rate, who are extremely important. They're doing things. They can tell you what you said that’s stupid, and you can think then why is that stupid, and generalize from there. They can model intelligent thinking in all kinds of domains.

Social Psychology,Health Psychology,Roxane Cohen Silver,CohenSilver,,"A few things that I expect will be different or at least, will have changed more quickly than we might have expected. First, I think that many people, certainly people who are, let's say, middle aged and older are embracing technology in ways that they might not have realized that they would be able to do, and do so quickly. Universities have switched very quickly to remote instruction, and individuals are communicating with their families and friends, across the country and across the world in ways that they might not have done so before the pandemic. I also think that individuals will newly embrace flexibility and understanding how to cope with loss of control, how to cope with isolation, to see the value of compliance factors that I think many people who encounter stressful life events learn, as they cope with crisis. And now, as we have a worldwide crisis in which we are embracing, many people will learn those skills and the value of those factors sooner than they might have otherwise done.","I'm most concerned about isolation, both isolation from one's loved ones and isolation amongst countries or within countries, not embracing the value of working with other people across the world. The necessity for isolation and lockdown across the world to prevent the spread of the coronavirus has led many people to lose touch with others, and again, it requires them an enormous amount of energy to reach out to others, the technology that we have available to us, but I am concerned about isolation and the psychological consequences of isolation and the societal consequences of isolation.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Social Psychology,,Roy Baumeister,Baumeister,,"One thing that people might hope for is that there will be a greater sense of social solidarity, that we're all working together. In our thinking about cultural change, there are changes that split and divide people and there are changes that bring people together. External threat certainly falls in the category of events that can bring a society together. So it would be in principle possible that coping with, this plague, this external threat, would be something that would increase members of the society's sense of finding something together. We might fantasize that it even would work at a global level, that we all around the world would realize, that as common humanity and with our common vulnerability to illness, we're all coping with the same problem. That's probably a bit much to hope for. But it could certainly work in countries that get through this by cooperating and working together.","Well, there's a toss-up, but to pick one: clearly the economic damage is a serious concern, which could compromise our society for a long period of time and potentially stunt the careers in life courses of countless young people who are at critical stages in their careers and in their life development. Another related thing is that lots of politicians look at a crisis as something they can use to advance their own agenda. And the phrase “don't let a good crisis go to waste” means oh, there's a problem, now we have a pandemic and people are getting sick. But, this is a chance to advance our other goals that we may have had before the pandemic was even an idea or concern in anyone's mind, let alone a reality. So, what happens in many of these cases will be an expansion of government power, more structures, more bureaucracy, and people when they are worried they are more willing to give up some of their freedom, see to an authority, which will take care of them. Now, it's an illusion, in this case, it's not clear if the government can really take care of us, the pandemic is a disease, but that would be the natural human impulse. One of the big ideas in there is demosclerosis, that as a state goes on, decade after decade, that it accumulates a stronger bureaucracy, more getting tied into special interests, who use the government for their own benefit, and prevent the government from doing its job to produce the general welfare.

Cultural Psychology,Neuroscience,Shinobu Kitayama,Kitayama,,"Recently I was looking into what happened in 1918 influenza pandemic. And people were really impacted by that pandemic back then. But there was no significant psychological, societal change afterward. So I'm not sure if there's any significant changes happening automatically. But this doesn't mean that no change is needed. The world has changed quite a bit since then. And most likely, this kind of pandemic infectious diseases will be more frequent, if anything, so unless the humanity prepares itself for future pandemic like this, even greater disaster can happen easily. And therefore, I really think that humans need to change, societies need to change, and the cultural norms must change. And those changes may not happen automatically. If you leave it to people without doing any active intervention, people will restore their life in a few years, hopefully, and they forget. So in all likelihood, nothing happens. Proactive efforts towards societal change may be called upon. And now what kind of change is required and that could be is the next question. And I think there are two critical things. One, the idea of globalization as inherently virtuous, must be evaluated. This requires major reassessment. Second, there must be really active effort to preserve ecological diversity and the preservation of habitats for non-human animals and the plants, which need to be separated from the human habitat. And, to realize those, I think our motivational system needs to change. Right now over the last several hundred years, especially in the western half of the hemisphere, virtue was based on achievement and social comparison. Now this needs to be changed. To the one that is based on more holistic value, and holistic virtue of coexistence of all elements on the earth, and beyond. ","If neither of the two changes I consider to be necessary that is reassessment of globalization in the reduction of the wealth disparity happens and then there'll be greater likelihood of even greater disasters, to humanity in some near future. Now why is that? Well, story is very simple. Globalization, essentially makes it possible for virus to travel easily. And two, disparity. Why disparity matters? Because once you segregate the poor, and put them in some segregated area, that place is most likely to be hit and attacked by the virus. It’s very clear in the United States, for example, that simply mortality is much higher for African Americans. For example, essentially prejudice, segregation, poverty, all those systemic factors really fuels the movement and activity of the virus and once this happens, the entire society cannot stay free from this. And therefore, one globalization and two racial segregation, wealth disparity needs to be addressed very systematically and aggressively to reduce the likelihood of future pandemic.",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1

Philosophy,,Steven Stich,Stich,,"A great deal has happened in the last four months. And I think in many cases, it's very hard to know how much of the response has been response to the pandemic and how much to other factors. One of the most positive societal changes that we've witnessed in the last few months is the growing awareness both intellectually and emotionally, of the serious racial injustice that exists in the United States. A major reason for that quantum jump in awareness certainly was the killing of George Floyd, and the excruciating video of that horrible event. I'm inclined to think that the pandemic actually contributed to the positive impact of the video. The economy's locked down, many people were working from home, there was more opportunity to see the video than there might have been prior to the pandemic. And since so many of us were suffering, we were perhaps primed to see and emphasize with the suffering that was portrayed on the video, and to begin to understand the impact that widespread racism of the sort that was so obvious in that video has had on the lives of millions of our fellow Americans. And, in addition, of course, large numbers of people joined the Black Lives Matter demonstrations. Here again, I think the pandemic may have facilitated that response. Schools and universities were closed, many people who were out of work, and the responsible news media made it clear that people of color were much more seriously impacted by the pandemic. I think it was sort of the perfect storm that forced many of us to see more clearly and to emphasize more vividly with the impact of racism and inequality.","that's a that's a very hard question because the pandemic will have so many negative impacts I'm really at a loss to predict which one ones will be the most significant. What I can say is that the negative impacts I personally worry about most are the ones that, not surprisingly, are closest to me. The devastating effect it's going to have on the careers of so many of the students that I work with. Graduate students are going to find it vastly more difficult to launch their academic careers. Many graduate students devoting three or four or five or six years to graduate training, are going to find that it's impossible to get a job at a college or university. Undergraduates are going to find it much more difficult to launch the careers they've been trained for and had been hoping for. So inevitably years are going to be lost. Life plans need to be put on hold. And I think in many cases, the income loss will never be recovered. The current generation of students is going to be worse off than their parents, almost certainly for the next decade and possibly for their entire lives. That may not be the most devastating impact of the pandemic. Afterall, hundreds of thousands by the time we're done, perhaps millions of lives will be lost.

My hope in practice is that this would mean increased support for universal health care in the US and for a more secure social safety net, which would have made a big difference in the US to how the pandemic played out and I think that could be a long lasting change that people understand the ways in which we're connected and the ways in which it's essential to support each other. ","Politically, I think there's a reason to worry that some leaders will take this as an opportunity to curtail individual liberty and increase social control beyond the point that's necessary to respond to the pandemic. I think we see that happening in some countries already. That’s a real concern. I know that there are parents who are worried about the long term consequences for this very fearful period on their children. Parents that I know are worried that their children will grow up with an increasing, greater sense of mistrust and fear of other people. They're also worried about the repercussions for children's education, and especially, I think as a society, we should be worried about the repercussions for the education of poor children who are disproportionately affected by the pandemic.

Cultural Psychology,Personality,Veronica Benet Martinez,BenetMartinez,,"I believe that one of the positive changes for sure has been the strengthening of relationships. The confinement, combined with fear, have really made people feel much more picky about which relationships to maintain and cultivate, namely family, close ones. But also has allowed opportunities for meeting new people that maybe have joined your classes or your zoom parties and you have had an opportunity to kind of get to know them in a non-interrupted way. During the zoom party or zoom meeting, it's been a sort of a much more kind of focused microscopic way of looking at this relationship. I'm sure some new emergent friendships neighbors have emerged that I will say the main positive change will be the strengthening of relationships we deem important. The second gain, I would say, is the savoring of experiences. I think that this uncertainty we have hovering over our heads all the time, has made us really savor whatever positive experiences we have, some of them social, some of them individual, and realize that they're special, that they're wonderful and we have taken them for granted. ","I think, ones that come to mind very easily, I'm sure to many others also, is fear of socializing and being out, that many people probably have some sort of existential despair about the fate of society and humanity, helplessness, about loss of loss of life, loss of significant others, jobs opportunities, being unable to use one’s skillset. I know people who basically will have to completely change their profession, because they have jobs that are basically going to disappear. So a frustration to see your professional identity, go out of the window like that, because of a pandemic where certain things and certain activities cease to exist. And I think all of this is going to be magnified for individuals who struggle with mental health issues and who have lack of social support and professional resources and stability.

Emotions,Wellbeing,Wendy Mendes,Mendes,,"It’s interesting to think about some of the positive aspects of the pandemic because what we know about human behavior and how we respond to stress is that there aren't always negative effects associated with stress, and that’s where the idea of resilience comes from, that people have the ability to adapt to new circumstances. And even in research where of maternal caregivers is the mothers with sick children, about 25 to 40% of women with sick children end up looking healthier because they find meaning in life and resilience. So not to put a positive spin on what is really sort of unprecedent unprecedented awful times, but since you asked me about positive change, the idea that the pandemic could potentially create more resilient profiles and understanding of meaning in life of what matters. And what matters is our loved ones, the people around us, our society or communities. When we consider the positive changes of the pandemic, the fact that people are connecting with old friends with remembering the values of the family because now they can't see them in some cases, helps remind us of the important things in life and so I think that is one of the positive changes that we could see.","When we're thinking about negative changes, it's important to think of the history of us as social beings and for millennia we have been used to and we've evolved to communicate with people face- to-face, in fact, it's only in our very recent evolutionary past, have we had the ability to communicate over video or telephones. So we have evolved to see each other and not just see each other, but also all of our senses smell, hear, directly touch. And so one of our critical sensorial features of communication is something like touch. Now, touch is powerful, especially when we think of it, in our smaller, close family circles. We're used to touching people we love, our family. We know from work, for example, by Jim Cohen, who shows that stress centers and fear centers in the brain down regulate with human touch, and it doesn't even have to be a loved one. It could be a stranger, so touch is powerful. And I think we're going to have to get used to not touching people. Even the idea of a handshake, extending and touching somebody who you're just meeting is useful. It's a way to sort of break down this barrier of being strangers and something like that right now would be ill advised. So we have to come up with ways to communicate, social connection and more, that doesn't require touch, and that I think will be very tricky for people, especially more in a Western culture.

Social Psychology,Cultural Psychology,Ying Yi Hong,Hong,,"I think in response to the pandemic, you see that many people work together, cooperate together in order to prevent and protect themselves from the COVID-19. And indeed, what we find is that, for example, in some of the countries, for example, in mainland China, we have data to show that people become more... higher, they'll hold higher identification with the nation. And also actually people who hold higher national identity engage more in preventive behaviors. So we see a reciprocal effect in terms of having higher national identity, they're more likely to engage in preventive behaviors, and the more they engage in preventive behavior, the higher they become, the higher they identify with the nation. So we saw that in China, and I think there are some data coming out of New Zealand as well. But you know, other places might not necessarily be the same. But what we find so far is: Higher national identity is related to higher preventive behaviors towards COVID-19. So I think that might suggest that, in order to prevent the disease, people cooperate more. People are more likely to help out each other, and as a result increase the cohesion of the group.","On the one hand, it's nice to have a higher group cohesion. But I also can see a downside of it if it's too extreme. So if you are so nationalistic in the sense that you only favor your in-group, but not, I mean, wanting to help out-group. Actually, this is a classic phenomenon when there is a lot of disease around or there is a high probability of contracting infectious disease many groups become more closed-off. They don't want to reach out to strangers, or people of the other group, people that they are not familiar with, because they are so afraid of contracting the disease. So some of this, actually, you might see happening when there are people from a place where the contagion, I mean the infection rate, is high. People might be more worried about people coming from those regions. ",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
Social Psychology,Cultural Psychology,Yoshi Kashima,Kashima,,"A change is the belief in change. People are going to think that there will be change and that belief of future changes are going to create changes themselves, in many ways, because they think that it's possible to change and they'll begin to act on it. So  the best thing that happened is that people are now beginning to think that there will be a change.","There will be a change and not all changes are going to be good for everybody. So there'll be something bad happening and the good changes as well. The power of a state, nation state that is going to increase in some parts of the world, but say in other parts of the world that might fail. And what that means is that the kind of institutional support for civil society and everyday life may be weakened especially in some failing states, but it can be strengthened for better or worse in some other parts and that could be a major problem in some areas. So, it could be positive in that the state power might enter say a domestic living and that could reduce for instance the problem of domestic violence at the same time, that means that the some of the sanctity of family life could be eroded, and the state power can come into that sort of private living. So, there’s are positive and negative. I really I wonder what is going to happen to the estate power?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
Cultural Psychology,Wellbeing,Yukiko Uchida,Uchida,,"My own research on the Great East Japan earthquake nine years ago in Japan suggested that people re-evaluate their ordinary lives and the strengths and their feelings of the gratitude towards family members or social networks. This coronavirus pandemic is also affecting their social bonds and we can re-evaluate how the pressures that each social bond we have. Then, in Japan, the most positive changes that people are able to see, the balance between work and private life. In general the Japanese business people stay in their office, longer time than other countries. Before the pandemic Japanese businessman, feel pressured by collectivistic organizational culture to work together and monitor each other. So the evaluation system is based on long working hours, the long working order signal for the high motivation and the commitment to the workplace in Japan. So, in addition due to the centralization in the Tokyo area, many business persons should commute by crowded trains and the average length of the commuting is around an hour. One way, I mean this will total two hours per day. So now after coronavirus pandemic working at home is more likely to be prevailed in Japanese context too. Then we can extend our family time and maybe this is the kind of moment to re-evaluate how precious our  significant other social relationships closer to each other. And the impact is far greater than other countries I think, maybe because of the gap between before the coronavirus pandemic and after coronavirus pandemic. So after teleworking, they found that it is not necessary at least some types of help, to go to the office while their sacrificing time for a long commute. Their now working style in the cultural norm should be changed. And in terms of the universal perspective, we can be more flexible to connect internationally with each other via SMS and an online communication. Before it was very common to visit some people by flying long distance to have a meeting. Holding an online meeting was optional at that time, but now it is becoming a standard that even small children can communicate with their family and relatives online. This is a new way of feeling connected each other so this is the kind of the positive impact to seek our new social life. So online and seeking work life balance.","In a Japanese context, they still feel that we have to monitor the work of colleagues or subordinates, even when the employees work at home. So, it is due to the system of evaluation, which depend heavily on an effort rather than the outcome. Maybe some types of the cultural context they pay attention to the time to make effort rather than outcome. So the under such cultural context we need to have some changes and without such changes this might have some negative impact because some people just try not to have evaluation by outcome of the work. This is kind of big challenge for us to shift from the effort base evaluation system to outcome evaluation system. It's kind of stressful for us. And we have another impersonal small chat, type of the conversation. So, for some people who do not want to be disturbed by others, reducing the possibility to have a chat with others could have a positive impact, but others, however, maybe they miss such kind of  refreshment or brainstorming or information sharing we usually obtained from the small chat in social interactions. But if they have no such kind of relationship and they feel lonely, then this kind of change also worsen their feeling of the loneliness. So that maybe should be overcome from the some societal wisdom to protect the people from the feeling of loneliness.",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1
