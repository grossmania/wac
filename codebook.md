# Setup
Each scientist was first presented with a preamble and standardized
prompts. The prompts were repeated during the interview.

## Preamble

My colleagues and I are interested in psychological and social change
within a few years after the pandemic (e.g., political changes, changes
in attitudes or behavior toward certain groups, changes in mental
health). We are also interested in the wisdom people will need to master
the pandemic -- i.e., attitudes, behaviors, or general strategies people
can use to successfully navigate the challenges ahead. The specific set
of questions I am asking each participant in this project is below:

## Questions

Q1.     If you were to predict the domain or aspect of social life where
we might observe the most significant positive societal and/or
psychological change in response to the pandemic, what would it be?

Q2. What kind of wisdom will people need to capitalize on for the
positive change you refer to above?

Q3.     If you were to predict the domain or aspect of social life where
we might observe the most significant negative societal and/or
psychological change in response to the pandemic, what would it be?

Q4. What kind of wisdom will people need to master to overcome this
major negative societal change after the pandemic?

Q5. What one piece of wisdom do you think it is important to give people
now to help them make it through the pandemic?

*Themes below are sorted by topic and alphabetically. They start with
responses corresponding to Q1 and proceed to unique themes throughout
until Q5. In case the same theme appears in response to multiple
questions, examples are provided for each.*

# Themes and example statements

## Question 1 themes 
**some also mentioned in Q2, Q4-Q5**

### Nature

Definition: Improved ecology and other aspects of nature and one's environment, such as cleaner air, less pollution, paying greater attention to landscape around us.

**Q1**

 * > There's no doubt that the biggest benefit of lockdown has been the impact on the environment, the air is cleaner. 

### Gratitude

Definition: being appreciative of / grateful for what one has.

**Q1**

* > People re-evaluate their ordinary lives and the strengths and their feelings of the gratitude towards family members or social networks.
* > We are probably going to be more appreciative of people we didn\'t appreciate enough  before.
* > People are sitting with the details of their life, their families, their actual environment, their actual landscape, much more than they have done in the past.

**Q4**

* > As the Dalai Lama says if in the morning you wake up and you're alive, this is already so much to be grateful for. And this pandemic reminds us of this simple wisdom. 

### Optimism / Positivity

 Definition: being hopeful and optimistic; includes believing in human ability, not panicking, remembering we will recover, realizing importance of expressing positive emotions.

**Q1**

* > People become more aware of
the importance of the
expression of positive 
emotions when they\'re in
ordinary day to day
interactions with others.

**Q4**

* > I think that one that is 
very important is to never 
lose hope and optimism, as 
the humankind has been able
to overcome all kinds of 
challenges, historical, the
macro level, that now, we
learn about in history 
books. 
 
* > We have to have a will to
keep imagining what may be a 
better way of living and 
participate in the discourse 
and acting on that.

**Q5**

* > Historically, we have experienced these types of pandemics multiple times,
yet we have successfully overcome these pandemics. So, I think it\'s very 
important to believe in our ability. 
 
* > I think it\'s really 
important for me,
personally, to believe in
humanity, hope that they 
keep on hoping I guess, have 
a will to hope, that there's 
a better way of living into
the future.

### Living in the moment

 Definition: experiencing what is 
 currently accessible, savoring 
 positive experience (incl. small 
 things), deriving pleasure from
 the moment and details of life.

**Q1**

* > Rather than planning a trip
abroad that\'s filled with 
mishaps and standing in the
rain and getting sick and
potentially not having a lot 
of pleasure, but then
deriving a lot of pleasure 
later when people give you 
social credit for doing that 
trip or where you can make 
it seem incredibly 
interesting. Instead of
doing that people are
walking to the store or
making bread or discovering
that the landscape around
their home, whether it\'s
urban or rural, is very
beautiful. 
 
* > I think that this
uncertainty we have hovering 
over our heads all the time, 
has made us really savor 
whatever positive
experiences we have, some of 
them social, some of them
individual, and realize that 
they\'re special, that 
they\'re wonderful and we
have taken them for granted. 

**Q2**

* > We need to slow down, and
just notice; notice things 
every day, the great gifts 
that we have in our lives
that we really take for
granted. I think many of us
now are starting to keep 
gratitude journals to think, 
what are the small things up 
to the big things that we
really realized that we
should be noticing, first
and foremost, that are so
precious to us even, like I
mentioned things that are
small things like being able 
to sit outside with a
friend, or hold someone\'s 
hand and hug people we have
to slow down, to be able to
do that, the better off
we\'ll be able to really 
kind of foster that positive 
change 

**Q4**

* > To me, recognition of the
fragility of life. And 
certainly, the COVID 
pandemic is reminding us of
that. It\'s really one of
the greatest gifts that we 
have, as humans. That is,
the abilities that we have.
To our knowledge, we are the 
only species that is aware 
of our mortality throughout
virtually all of our lives.
And this appreciation for
fragility contributes to a 
concern for the world, as we 
know it. It allows us to see 
what\'s important and
what\'s not important. 

**Q5**

* > My advice is that, not to be 
too panicked about it. 
We\'ve been through this 
before, and just stay
relaxed, enjoy the time to 
contemplate not being so 
overwhelmed by crowds of 
people.

### Personal resilience

 Definition: having/developing
 the capacity to cope with 
 difficulties. 

**Q1**

* > I also think that
individuals will newly 
embrace flexibility and
understanding how to cope
with loss of control, how to 
cope with isolation, to see
the value of compliance
factors that I think many
people who encounter 
stressful life events learn, 
as they cope with crisis.
 
* > What some study have shown 
is that people actually
acquire resilience during
this pandemic, 
psychologically, and there 
were no drastic change in
terms of people\'s 
experience of loneliness.

### Health & well-being

 Definition: sustained or
 improved physical and mental
 health following the pandemic
 and factors that such 
 improvements are contingent on.

**Q1**

* > couples who are able to be 
resilient over time also may 
do better in terms of their
health, and general
wellbeing. 

### Improve work-life balance

 Definition: the capacity to 
 balance work and private life

**Q1**

* > This coronavirus pandemic is 
also affecting their social
bonds and we can re-evaluate 
how the pressures that each
social bond we have. Then, 
in Japan, the most positive
changes that people can see
is the balance between work
and private life. In 
general, the Japanese
businesspeople stay in their 
office longer time than
other countries. 

**Q2**

* > Work life balance. We need 
to decrease our work time, 
increase our family time.
Companies should restructure 
their work culture so that 
employees can have better
work-life balance. I think 
that\'s the wisdom we need.

### Embrace new tech

 Definition: embracing/using 
 technology for remote 
 interpersonal contact, including 
 new technological developments.

**Q1**

* > Certainly, people who are
middle aged and older are
embracing technology in ways 
that they might not have 
realized that they would be
able to do and do so 
quickly. Universities have 
switched very quickly to 
remote instruction, and
individuals are
communicating with their 
families and friends, across 
the country and across the 
world in ways that they
might not have done so 
before the pandemic. 
 
* > When this pandemic started 
doing things on zoom was 
kind of unique, and it was 
kind of interesting. I had a 
birthday party at the end of 
March, and we had 20 people
on zoom, and that was kind 
of fun.

**Q2**

* > For the second question, the 
kind of wisdom people will 
need in order to work from 
home. My answer is 
familiarity with computers,
teleconferencing, social 
media, and information 
technology in general.   

**Q5**

* > And if I were young, and had 
a job as a waiter or 
waitress, I\'d be trying to
learn some of that stuff. So 
that I can be ready for the
for the future, we\'re never 
probably going to stop 
interacting online the way 
we are now because it\'s so
convenient. Learn about
these things, learn about
this technology, because 
there's going to be some
money in it. 

### Reconsidering habits

 Definition: questioning previous 
 ways of life (e.g., work, 
 travel) and redefining what 
 "normal" implies. 

**Q1**

* > But with a pandemic, and 
with the change in work
mode, people started asking
questions like, is this
essential? Is this 
necessary? Is this really a
must? Is this travel a 
requirement? Do we have to 
travel to get this work
done?
 
* > Many people are asking about 
the way our society works or 
the way my life works, what
is working or not working. 
And that\'s not inherently 
positive, except that it 
sets up a frame of mind that 
makes it easier to change
habits because we start to 
ask ourselves what should be 
different. 

### Improve care for elders

 Definition: rethinking how we
 care for elderly, including 
 calls for more funding/policies. 

**Q1**

* > On the other hand, there\'s
a chance that we\'ll think 
more seriously about how we
care about the frail elderly 
and that we will force 
governments to enact 
legislation and think about
putting more funding into
these contexts in order to 
prevent what should have 
been a totally foreseeable 
consequence in terms of the
effects of COVID-19 and long 
term care homes. 

### Prosocial Behavior

 Definition: includes prosocial 
 behavior (i.e., helping,
 sharing, donating, co-operating, 
 supporting others, and
 volunteering), increased
 tolerance of others, being
 considerate of others.

**Q1**

* > I\'m hoping that we\'re
going to see a lot more
community engagement from
individuals after this 
pandemic. Early on in the
process, we saw a lot of 
people joining mutual aid
groups or other kinds of 
voluntary associations,
people helping their 
neighbors offering to go and 
get food or medications for
them, people actually
started to speak much more 
to those people who live 
around them. 
 
* > I think that might suggest 
that, in order to prevent
the disease, people
cooperate more. People are 
more likely to help each 
other, and as a result,
increase the cohesion of the 
group. 

**Q5**

* > Caring about other people, 
care about your family, care 
about your friends, help 
where you can without
jeopardizing your safety.
Helping other people, it\'s
also something that makes us 
feel good, and is good for 
wellbeing. So, care. 

### Social connectedness

Definition: paying attention to
 importance of interpersonal 
 relationships, maintaining
 relationships.

**Q1**

* > Compared with before the 
pandemic, people during this 
pandemic feel more connected 
with the community. Tighter
family relationships would 
be the most positive outcome 
of this. 

**Q2**

* > I think there\'s a force in
our society that says you
need to separate yourself, 
but I think that\'s sort of
the one obstacle is that 
look, it\'s okay to be 
friends with your kin. You 
can trust your kin and it
keeps the network of 
potential infections 
smaller. So again, I think 
people will do it naturally. 
And the only wisdom would
be, don\'t pay attention to
your cultural value that you 
should separate yourself 
from your family.

**Q4**

* > What I\'m saying is call 
your grandma. And just keep
in touch with those
relationships because
there\'s just a lot of 
loneliness out there.
 
* > We\'ll need also to engage 
in reaching out to others
when they feel distraught or 
when they feel particularly
distressed, and people may 
need to reach out to their 
loved ones to ensure that
they too are coping well.
 
* > And also, very important to
maintain social connections
and social support.

**Q5**

* > If we are to learn something 
from the past and from 
previous pandemics, we know
that whoever was organized 
in a very tight communities, 
and has a greater change 
chance to go in those times
without the significant, you 
know, byproducts if you
wish, because communal 
organization is something
that can provide for the 
very individual person,
provide the psychological
umbrella, and financial
assistance in times that 
person and individual needs
that assistance. 

### Shared humanity

 Definition: recognizing that we
 all share a common human
 experience / fate.

**Q1**

* > I think the number one piece 
of wisdom is that we\'re all 
in it together. And that has 
been bandied around but I
think that it is really the
case that it is important
for us to protect our loved
ones, protect our friends, 
protect their neighbors, and 
in doing so we will protect
ourselves. 

**Q2**

* > I think stressing the common 
humanity would help us enjoy 
this unifying effect.

**Q4**

* > This pandemic taught us that 
we are all biological
beings, we are all 
vulnerable to the virus. So
regardless of our race,
gender, ethnicity, we are
the same biological beings.
I think that\'s the wisdom 
we need to have. 
 
* > Humankind must come to 
understand that we share the 
earth's bounty and its 
vulnerability, both of those 
aspects of our being born. 

### Solidarity

 Definition: prioritizing needs 
 of vulnerable groups (e.g., 
 elders), thinking more "we" and
 less "me" within your group,
 taking care of each other, doing 
 what is best for all. Overcoming 
 how we compartmentalize people 
 as trustworthy or not.
 interpersonal cohesion, trust, 
 "we-ness", sense that we are in
 this together.

**Q1**

* > I think the biggest change 
will be where people will
look to their community
rather than the central
government.

**Q2**

* > The realization that what
matters is the common good 
and not petty ideologies.
That sounds simple. But
right now, many countries or 
many tribes within those 
countries are focused on 
petty ideologies, ignorance
of facts, ignorance of 
science, ignorance of
ethics. And we need to shift 
their emphasis to the common 
good, doing what will help 
not just ourselves or our
tribe, but what\'s good for
all. 

**Q4**

* > The main thing is the
realization that to achieve
a common good, to do what\'s 
best for all.
 
* > maybe this is a kind of a
practice run to get us all 
working together, and then 
using the established
connections to work on 
global warming and maybe 
other global problems. 

**Q5**

* > It might be also a good time 
to reflect on how we might 
be able to contribute in 
helping not just ourselves 
to adjust and adapt but help 
the community as a whole.

### Sympathy & compassion

 Definition: being 
 compassionate/showing concern
 for others, includes being good
 listeners and communicating 
 warmth. 

**Q1**

* > Probably one positive effect 
of tears could be that 
everybody will feel empathy
for others who are affected
more severely no matter
where they live. 

**Q2**

* > I think that people will 
need to recognize the value
of flexibility and the value 
of compassion and the value
of giving themselves a break 
 
* > So, if that\'s part of what
comes out of COVID for some
people, as wisdom, I expect
it will have some payoff in
enhancing empathy. 

**Q4**

* > People who haven\'t lost 
their job, people who
haven\'t lost relatives, 
people who haven\'t lost 
friends. I think what they 
must do is show compassion 
and empathy, as it\'s time 
for those around us who
haven\'t been as lucky as
the luckiest among us. 

**Q5**

* > So being friendly, open and
compassionate to ourselves 
can help us become more open 
and compassionate to others
and in the end, to get 
through these challenging
times. 
 
* > And that ability to get used 
to uncertainty is very 
difficult to have, to give 
yourself a little bit of 
self-compassion and your 
family members and your
friends who are all
struggling with this same
problem. 

### Political engagement & structural change

 Definition: proactive efforts to 
 bring social change and raising
 awareness of societal 
 shortcomings; engaging in policy 
 making/civic government,
 activism, structural change, to
 bring about social change (incl. 
 support for telehealth, police 
 accountability).

**Q1**

* > This pandemic has
underscored societal 
inequalities along age,
class, ethnic, regional and
gender lines. The pandemic 
has not caused these 
inequalities, but it\'s put
a spotlight on them. Disease 
affects certain ethnic and 
age groups more than others, 
a woman\'s contribution to 
the economy is likely to be
hit harder than man\'s, and
those who have entered 
COVID-19 with ongoing major
problems such as poverty,
political instability, and 
corruption, will have a
harder time coming out of it 
in one piece. Alongside of 
all this, we have also 
realized one more time, that 
we all depend on each other
in our lives are 
interconnected in so many
different ways. I expect and 
perhaps more so hope, that 
this picture will motivate 
us to work towards 
understanding why this 
pandemic hit certain groups
harder than others. As a 
result, it will motivate us
to pick up a stronger fight
against the unfair 
distribution of resources
and rights not just where we 
live, but much more
globally.

**Q2**

* > Proactive efforts towards
societal change may be 
called upon. 
 
* > My hope is, optimistically,
that will end I\'m seeing a
lot of positive change from
this, in terms of policy in
terms of civic and 
government involvement, and
that we can try to do this 
together in a way that\'s
not as divisive.

**Q4**

* > And finally, emerging out of 
the Black Lives Matter 
movement we will always need 
an accountable policing
force to keep one another in 
check locally, and also
internationally. 
 
* > Staying politically engaged
is crucial to capitalize on
the positive stuff, I think
that\'s also the case for
these more negative
elements.

### Bipartisanship and political cooperation

 Definition: process by which
 political groups and/or nations
 work together to a shared goal.

**Q1**

* > one place that we might see
benefit, or something
positive coming from this
very difficult time is an
appreciation, greater
appreciation, of the need
for collaboration at 
transnational levels.

**Q2**

* > Those that divide other
people that attack other 
people, that increase
political polarization, that 
vilify you people who
disagree with you. My hope 
is, optimistically, that 
will end I\'m seeing a lot 
of positive change from
this, in terms of policy in
terms of civic and 
government involvement, and
that we can try to do this 
together in a way that\'s
not as divisive. 
 
* > Globalization essentially
left behind many people. It
simply because the wealth
was concentrated on the
people who capitalize on 
information, technology and
that\'s benefited from 
globalization. \[...\]I f
globalization is to
continue, which I hope it
will, all globalization must 
proceed by incorporating the 
poor and underdeveloped
countries. Globalization 
must be detached from
international business 
competition. 

**Q4**

* > As moral decent creatures we 
do better by working 
together to combat a common
problem, rather than to
fight each other.

**Q5**

* > Benjamin Franklin \[...\]
said, we must all hang 
together or most assuredly,
we will all hang separately. 
This is a pun in English of
course, based on the sense 
that hang together means 
cooperate or work in 
conjunction with one 
another, to achieve joint
outcomes 
 
* > If I were to distill it to 
one thing, I would distill 
it to the idea that lives
are more important than
ideology. that the future is 
more important than short
term gratifications. That we 
should never lose sight of 
the effects of what we do, 
not only on our own lives, 
but on the lives of others 
around the world, and of 
future generations. And that 
preserving the world for the 
future is more important 
than the ideologies that 
inspire people to behave 
recklessly.

### Critical thinking

 Definition: asking questions and 
 thinking critically about 
 information in a way that avoids 
 bias; unbiased reasoning. 

**Q1**

* > People started asking
questions that they might
not have even considered 
asking before  
 
* > I think some people, and a 
lot of kids, are being 
exposed to how you think 
about information? How do
you think about data? How do 
you think about evidence,
and more to the point, how 
do you do it in a scientific 
way? What does science look
like?  

**Q2**

* > Some who may be more 
vulnerable than we are, and
will need most of all
rationality, the ability not 
to be influenced by our
prejudices and our biases, 
but instead think reasonably 
and rationally but in a
crisis that we find
ourselves in.  
 
* > And we must become experts 
and be able to tell which
experts to follow, who has a 
sound voice and who is 
giving us information
that\'s going to mislead and 
maybe harm us.
 
**Q4**

* > It\'s really reflecting on 
what we want to influence
us. That really sort of
asking in a careful way, 
what is influencing me? And
are these the influences I 
want to shape my worldview?
And I think for many of us 
we'll realize, no, I don\'t
want my worldview shaped by
kind of nasty human
tendencies, I want to think
better and be better. I
think most people have that
default response.  
 
* > There are a lot of these 
suspicions and biases that 
are flaring up right now 
creating impediments for 
understanding that we\'re
going to have to kind of 
tackle in a reasoned way.  

**Q5**

* > Yes, people are getting
sick, and some are dying.
But understand that it\'s a
property of the human mind 
to overestimate the problems 
and the danger and the 
downside.  
 
* > A lot of the things that 
we\'re facing now a lot of 
the, difficult moral 
decisions are about
meaningful things in both
categories, trading safety,
grandparents lives against 
things like reopening
schools for children\'s
lives, restarting the
economy to save the
livelihoods of everybody 
protesting in order to fight 
for justice. These are all 
sacred values, not secular 
values. And so, the
decisions that we\'re
actually making are
difficult ones. I think the
simple act of deliberation 
has become moralized. The
fact that people are 
actually considering these 
decisions is seen as morally 
gross and I think that\'s a
level of ungenerousness to 
the challenges that other
people are facing. 

### Learning from the pandemic(s)

 Definition: learning from the
 mistakes made at the start of
 COVID-19, as well as history,
 implementing these moving 
 forward; learning from past 
 experiences.

**Q1**

* > This is maybe even more
important, a means through 
which these challenges can 
be met. So, it\'s really 
been an unprecedented
learning opportunity.

**Q2**

* > if we have the wisdom to 
critically self-reflect on 
the mistakes that we\'ve 
made and to learn from them, 
then we\'ll be better
prepared to respond swiftly
and sensibly, and
thoughtfully to future 
challenges.

**Q5**

* > knowledge of how pandemics 
have ended in the past in
'68, '57, for example, the 
1918, 1919 this is 
important. 

### Interest in science

 Definition: pursuing sciences
 for higher education, as
 inspired by COVID-19. 

**Q1**

* > I imagine much like a lot of 
my generation went into
science because of Sputnik,
a lot of people are going to 
go into health and science 
because of this situation. 

## Question 2 themes 
**some also mentioned in Q4-Q5**

### Acknowledge uncertainty/flexibility

 Definition: accepting 
 uncertainty, adapting quickly to 
 new circumstances, being
 flexible. 

**Q2**

* > We need to accept the
possibility that there is
and will be a lot of 
uncertainty, we need to be 
able to adjust and adapt 
very quickly.  
 
* > It feels like at this time 
of change, an important part 
of our mindset is to adjust
and adapt, is to accept the
fact that there could be a 
lot of uncertainties and 
that we need to handle and 
try to able to be adapted to 
deal with.   

**Q4**

* > Flexibility. A willingness 
to walk away from what the 
economist calls "sunk
costs." Yes, it really sucks 
to invest years in 
preparation for a career 
you\'ll probably never have. 
But I think the people who 
do best in dealing with the
situation are going to be
those who assess the 
situation accurately, and
refocus their goals, those 
flexible.  

**Q5**

* > Things might change so 
quickly; change by the day 
or by the minute or by the 
hour. And so, we need to be
able to adjust and adapt.  
 
* > And there are elements of my 
life and the world that are
going to be a bit more 
uncertain right now. And 
that ability to get used to
uncertainty is very
difficult to have, to give 
yourself a little bit of 
self-compassion and your 
family members and your
friends who are all
struggling with this same
problem. 

### Intellectual humility

 Definition: acknowledging there
 may be gaps in knowledge and
 mistakes made, questioning what
 we know.

**Q2**

* > The issue isn\'t so much do
we have the wisdom, it\'s do 
we think about what is 
wisdom mean for how we 
approach this situation? 
What do we know? How could 
we be better? It\'s not that 
we don\'t know the answer to 
what are the values we might 
aspire to, but as rather 
than we\'re not really aware 
of them in our day to day
life, so the wisdom is 
really more about becoming 
more persistently aware of 
those things that we care
about and the way we want to 
structure our lives. 
 
* > And it\'ll be even perhaps 
greater tragedy if these 
individuals fail to admit
their mistakes, fail to, to
learn from those mistakes

### Evidence-based decision-making

 Definition: gathering scientific 
 knowledge prior to making 
 decisions.

**Q2**

* > a huge amount of research
that needs to be done. 
Rather than people 
automatically doing internet 
communication or 
automatically doing
classroom education, let\'s
have some idea what kind of
subjects and what kind of
people it would make sense 
for. 

**Q4**

* > You just need to do the
research and find out what 
kinds of teachers, what
kinds of topics, what kinds
of students are best doing 
online.

### Improve communication

 Definition: prioritizing in 
 person communication, finding
 new ways to communicate emotion, 
 developing and improving online
 communication, focusing on real
 time communication (e.g., rather 
 than texting, having live 
 conversation).

**Q2**

* > So I think this ability to 
be able to connect with
people virtually, will help
this positive change, help 
us connect, remind us that 
we can reach out and no you
can\'t, touch your loved 
one, but you can find sort 
of solace in being able to 
communicate with them
directly over video. 

**Q4**

* > People are going to have to
think about why something
like face to face
communication and touch, why 
that makes them feel better
and trying to find a proxy 
that fits. 
 
* > Recognizing and
understanding the
consequences of
deindividuation. And that\'s 
part of the wisdom. The
other part is to counteract
it.

**Q5**

* > To try to support each other 
and still focus on those 
relationships, and to focus
on that, and focus on real 
time communication, as 
opposed to being so tempted
as we all are, to go to
social media and to go to
texting, and so on, which is 
an in real time, and it has
those performative aspects 
to it and just doesn\'t seem 
to be as good for mental 
health as actually having a
conversation.

### Social Support

 Definition: providing/having
 adequate social support.

**Q2**

* > we also have to realize that 
we\'re more responsible for
other people, for the
well-being of other people,
than we might know and like. 
We are responsible for each
other\'s well beings, even 
for people we don\'t even
know very well, for people 
don\'t look like us, who 
don\'t act like us, and who
we might consider to be
strangers. 

**Q4**

* > And also very important to 
maintain social connections
and social support. In the 
past, busy with our very,
very varied and dynamic and
highly mobile lives we were
not perhaps cultivating as 
much as we are now.

### Self-reflection on what's important

 Definition: focus on what's 
 meaningful, and contentedness. 
 Considering what we value and
 gaining insight into the meaning 
 of our life.

**Q2**

* > What you hear people saying
are things like, wow, time 
is slowing down, I can slow
down time, sometimes too 
much, but that's an option 
that we have in our
fast-paced lives. Wow, 
social interactions, and 
hugging people are the most
important thing in my life,
and I feel depressed without 
them, and I\'ll return to
that. Or I don\'t need to
shop and burn carbon fuels 
so much I think we 
collectively as we move
through this pandemic, this
panic and this trauma, 
we\'ll start to arrive at a
set of core ethical
principles like we tend to,
and go forward with those
more explicitly recognized.
 
* > The wisdom is really more
about becoming more
persistently aware of those
things that we care about
and the way we want to 
structure our lives. 

**Q4**

* > A third piece of wisdom is 
that contentedness is a
better personal goal than
happiness. 
 
* > I think that meaning making
is a very important ability, 
skill, form of wisdom that 
we need to have to be able 
to write a story about 
what\'s been happening 
integrate this in the story
of our lives, and who we 
are, and share those stories 
with others. 

**Q5**

* > It is important to, stop and 
rethink about what we have 
defined as normal life as
very normal or not. Was it 
normal to commute more than
one hour a day? Or was it
normal not to talk to your 
family members because you 
were so busy, or was it
normal to fly frequently to
other areas in busy
schedule? Or was it normal 
to make a lot of consumption 
in a daily basis? I think
this situation we have to
think about what our 
individual happiness is and
what is our societal 
happiness. 
 
* > As we shut down and have 
this period of solitude, and 
which is hard, that people 
ask themselves what they\'re 
finding really meaningful at 
this moment, and to develop
that as they go forward. 

### Self-distancing

 Definition: taking a step back 
 and looking at ourselves within
 the social context. 
 Psychological distance. A form 
 of mindfulness exercise allowing 
 you to put yourself/your issues
 into a broader perspective
 (e.g., of the issues concerning
 the whole planet).

**Q2**

* > Not social distancing, as
we\'ve seen, but 
self-distancing, and I think 
it\'s learning that you must 
learn that some of the 
ideals or values that define 
us, maybe aren\'t that 
essential to who we are. And 
once we\'ve got to 
self-distancing, we may be 
better to interact with
people on the other side,
whatever the other side
looks like.

**Q4**

* > It\'s really reflecting on 
what we want to influence
us. That really sort of
asking in a careful way, 
what is influencing me? And
are these the influences I 
want to shape my worldview?

**Q5**

* > Remember you're a social 
animal. Remember that. You 
need other people to keep
yourself healthy. And you
need social connection to
keep your well-being intact. 
And other people need
you\.... Remember that your
biology doesn\'t only belong 
to you, you spread it around 
every time you breathe. If 
everybody remembers that 
they can have a good impact
on other people or a bad 
impact on other people they
can choose to be the kind of 
person who has a good
impact, they can choose to 
be their best self.

### Perspective-taking

 Definition: being appreciative 
 of diverse perspectives,
 considering the perspective of 
 others. 

**Q2**

* > Essential for wisdom is
perspective taking, being
able to see the world as 
other people see it so that
you can be helpful to them.
 
* > The first one, is openness 
to others, as different as 
it may be. I think we should 
learn to open to others, 
even if they come from the 
other side, whatever the 
other side is. 

**Q4**

* > And you have to balance
different interests against
each other, and that 
includes the interests of
people who are not like
yourself, people who are 
members of different 
so-called tribes. So, if 
you\'re in our country, a
Republican, that includes
Democrats, and if you\'re a
Democrat, that includes
Republicans. 
 
* > It requires this notion of 
reflection, but reflection 
that\'s not as a clinician 
might refer to it, 
rumination that is, not
cycling through the bad
thoughts and focusing on 
those, but actually
reflecting on and taking the 
perspective of other people
and learning to ask other
people about what their
states are like and learning 
to learn about other people. 

**Q5**

* > So, the first one has to do
with perspective taking. For 
a lot of people, some bit of 
perspective taking can help. 
That is, what people have
been going through, feels
hard and the uncertainty 
associated with it feels 
hard and the hits that 
they\'ve taken to their
well-being their way of
life, to their jobs, to the
health of friends and
family, it\'s hard.
 
* > Realizing that our problems
are relatively small 
compared to what others are
enduring might be a first
step to motivating us help 
to change the conditions 
that has made this pandemic
so bad for some reason. It 
could also be that having
some perspective where we
realize that for those of us 
for whom this is true that 
our problems are small 
compared to people in other
groups.

### Balance of personal and others' interest

 Definition: balancing personal 
 liberties (e.g., bodily 
 autonomy) with the interests of
 others (e.g., protecting others
 from virus). MUST mention 
 balance.  

**Q2**

* > The pandemic is demanding
that we find a way to
balance our legitimate 
concerns about freedom and 
autonomy with equally
legitimate concerns about
security and finding the 
right balance between those
two will require us to 
develop a kind of judgment,
a situation by situation 
judgment.

**Q4**

* > We need wise leaders who can 
balance the values of
liberty and privacy against
the values of saved lives. 

**Q5**

* > And so each of us has to 
sort of figure out for 
ourselves, and the 
particular circumstances 
we\'re living in and the 
people who depend on us and
what they need, how those
balances get maintained, how 
to balance our concern for 
others with what we need,
and how to balance our 
concern with being able to 
be free in the world, with 
our concern about being
protected and secure.  
 
* > Before coronavirus pandemic, 
we defined some normal life
as lots of consumption, lots 
of mobility and busy life we 
defined as normal. But 
maybe, it\'s kind of too 
much for us and also, we 
have to think about the good 
balance between individual 
level happiness and also 
societal happiness which can 
construct each other.

## Question 3 themes

### Authoritarianism

 Definition: includes increasing
 authoritarianism, rise of power
 for authoritarian states, 
 susceptibility to authoritarian
 influence.

**Q3**

* > What I would flag would be 
shortcomings and the 
capabilities and the 
prestige of democracies. So, 
this is a geopolitical 
point, but it\'s also a
point related to domestic
politics. The example of the 
United States faltering
right now is so profound,
and will be so profound for
people around the world. 
 
* > And the costs that come with 
deindividuation are things 
like not feeling responsible 
for one\'s particular
behavior or being unusually
susceptible to social norms. 

### Erosion of democratic institutions

 Definition: allowing others to 
 provide easy answers and steer 
 us, includes demosclerosis. 
 decreased trust in institutions
 and decreased political 
 engagement. 

**Q3**

* > One of the big ideas in
there is demosclerosis, that 
as a state goes on, decade 
after decade, that it
accumulates a stronger 
bureaucracy, more getting
tied into special interests, 
who use the government for 
their own benefit, and 
prevent the government from
doing its job to produce the 
general welfare. 
 
* > Some people did know. and in 
some states and some 
provinces, and in some 
countries, they did
anticipate, and they did a 
lot better. So I think they
should be held to account. 
But I\'m worried there\'ll 
be a lack of trust and, and
the consequences of that can 
be very, very negative. It 
can lead to walking away 
from the political process,
not leading to experts, it 
could lead to a lot of 
things short of violence and 
that are negative- not 
voting.
 
* > The most negative change 
that I\'ve observed during 
this pandemic is a loss of 
faith and trust in the 
institutions and governments 
and organizations in our 
lives. 

### Political conflict

 Definition: includes
 geopolitical tensions,
 intergroup conflict, internal
 political violence, political
 polarization. 

**Q3**

* > We\'re all asking what comes 
next? What does this mean
for the way our society is 
structured? Those are
difficult questions. And who 
poses the answers to those 
questions? Is it the case
that autocratic leaders
might answer those questions 
for us, might give us an 
easy answer where the answer 
is essentially, it\'s
because of them, it\'s 
because of the out group. We 
know that people can be
really easy pulled into
these kinds of intergroup
conflicts. 
 
* > The other is wars promoted 
by groups who are exploiting 
weakened military and legal
resistance that internal 
political systems create 
potentiating the possibility 
for internal political 
violence.

### Mistrust

 Definition: developing mistrust
 towards outgroups, people who
 look and think differently, and
 strangers.

**Q3**

* > I think there\'s going to be 
more ethnocentrism, not
necessarily ethnic, but kind 
of, geocentric, there\'s 
going to be more 
geocentrism. We\'re going to 
like the people around us
and be averse to hanging out 
with people from faraway 
foreign places.
 
* > my concern is that there\'s
going to be this persistent, 
lasting wariness of
interactions with other
people, especially 
strangers. that represents a 
low-level erosion of 
interpersonal trust and
erosion of social capital. 

### Prejudice & racism

 Definition: developing biased
 opinions of others, xenophobia,
 discrimination on basis of race. 

**Q3**

* > And there\'s an opportunity, 
unfortunately, for increased 
racism in certain cases. 
Consequently, stereotypes, 
prejudices against other 
group members might arise. 

### Estrangement & Alienation

 Definition: lower quality 
 interactions (online vs face to
 face), social isolation, reduced 
 work interactions, being wary of 
 interacting with others;
 deindividuation, ignoring 
 unfamiliar people.

**Q3**

* > The negative change that I 
worry about is that people 
will slowly begin to ignore
unfamiliar people within 
their social network.  
 
* > But I can see people at one
another\'s throats in a few
months, rather than looking
to provide aid. I think we 
have to really, really worry 
about the anti-social
consequences, immoral
consequences that could
arise if the situation gets
desperate enough.  

### Prioritize self over others

 Definition: decreased sense of 
 responsibility and increased
 self-centeredness.

**Q3**

* > When people are threatened,
when people perceive real
danger, they kind of pull
in, and they focus entirely
on themselves. 
 
* > As people become more
socially distanced and 
isolated, they may lose some 
of the skills of face to 
face interaction. They may 
start to become more in
their own heads, and less
adept at connecting to other 
people.

### Pessimism

 Definition: becoming cynical and 
 pessimistic.  

**Q3**

* > Cynicism and a sense of
despair are certainly
growing in some quarters.  
 
* > So one of the negative 
things that we have to be
cautious of is not letting,
or being shown, about
what\'s going on in the
world, to mislead us about 
how people behave, we can
become cynics when a lot of
people are acting in a very
non cynical, very
cooperative way. 

### Decreased trust in science

 Definition: increased mistrust & 
 skepticism in science & data.  

**Q3**

* > It is this suspicion of
science and the suspicion of 
data, that we have strong
ways of understanding this 
epidemic that have really
been undermined in the 
United States by kind of 
this suspicion that
pandemics elicit that\'s 
very worrisome.  
 
* > Skepticism about the 
efficacy of science. 

### Irrationality

 Definition: includes black and 
 white thinking & belief in
 conspiracy theories.

**Q3**

* > Research shows that when we
are faced with a threat of 
death, or with some greater
uncertainty, we might stop 
thinking critically and we 
might start behaving in more 
irrational ways. 
 
* > This pandemic might
encourage further growth of
black and white thinking,
conspiracy theories, 
prejudice and social 
antagonism.

### Misperception of the world

 Definition: media driven
 misperception of reality, spread 
 of misinformation (e.g., fake
 news).

**Q3**

* > I don\'t know how many 
videos I\'ve seen of people
massively upset because
you\'ve been asked to wear 
masks in the local 
supermarket. They\'re
outrageous. They can make
you angry. But they could
also give you a tilted view
of what\'s really going on 
with people, what people are 
really doing. You may focus
on the person not wearing
the mask and being upset,
but you may not notice all 
the other people in the
store wearing the mask that
they\'ve been asked to wear. 
 
* > So one of the negative 
things that we have to be
cautious of is not letting,
or being shown, about
what\'s going on in the
world, to mislead us about 
how people behave, we can
become cynics when a lot of
people are acting in a very
non cynical, very
cooperative way. 

### Decreased well-being

 Definition: decreased happiness, 
 health, increased psychological
 distress, increased mental
 health crisis.

**Q3**

* > A lot of people are
experiencing a lasting hit 
on their health and
well-being.  
 
* > I just saw today, from those 
who administer the General 
Social Survey, they sample 
in May, looking at happiness 
and happiness is at a
50-year low. 

### Autobiographical memory

 Definition: poor
 autobiographical memory due to 
 restricted movement/the pandemic 
 and subsequent inability to 
 differentiate contexts and
 feelings in one's life. 

**Q3**

* > lots of folks have told me 
that they feel like one
event just blends into the 
other, blends in together in 
their memory. And I worry
that we may wind up with a 
kind of collective fog in
our memories for these 
couple of years. 

### Despair

 Definition: implies a sense of 
 hopelessness, including 
 existential despair, distinct
 from mental health decline  

**Q3**

* > I\'m mostly worried about
despair at a social and
psychological level. 
 
* > Fear of socializing and
being out that many people 
probably have some sort of 
existential despair about
the fate of society and
humanity.  

### Loneliness

 Definition: includes
 psychological consequences of
 social isolation. 

**Q3**

* > But if they have no such 
kind of relationship and 
they feel lonely, then this
kind of change also worsen 
their feeling of the 
loneliness.
 
* > But I am concerned about 
isolation and the
psychological consequences 
of isolation and the 
societal consequences of 
isolation. 

### Poor intimate relations

 Definition: decline in quality 
 of intimate relationships with 
 one's partner, break-ups, 
 conflict in relationship
 domain/close others. IG/OT
 Comment: Keep an eye out for
 close relationships that are not 
 intimate (e.g., family/close
 friends) being mentioned in 
 other entries.

**Q3**

* > We know from many research 
studies that when people are 
faced with stress that comes 
from outside the 
relationship, such as
financial or job stress, 
they\'re more likely to
interact with their partner
in ways that are potentially 
damaging to the
relationship. They\'re more
likely to be overly
critical, or argue, to blame 
their partner to find it 
harder to listen to their
partner\'s concerns and
understand their partner\'s
perspective. And over time,
they may become less 
satisfied with their 
relationship and may even
break up. So, couples who
are most vulnerable, those 
facing the most severe 
economic hardship, also may
suffer the most damage to
their relationships over the 
long term. 

### Career disruption

 Definition: derailed career 
 plans and greater competition, 
 rethinking career goals.

**Q3**

* > Graduate students are going
to find it vastly more 
difficult to launch their
academic careers. Many 
graduate students devoting 
three or four or five or six 
years to graduate training,
are going to find that it\'s 
impossible to get a job at a 
college or university. 
Undergraduates are going to
find it much more difficult
to launch the careers
they\'ve been trained for
and had been hoping for.   
 
* > I know people who basically
will have to completely
change their profession, 
because they have jobs that
are basically going to 
disappear. So a frustration
to see your professional 
identity, go out of the
window like that, because of 
a pandemic where certain 
things and certain 
activities cease to exist. 

### Economic hardship

 Definition: job and income loss
 at individual/family level. loss 
 of profits, wages, earnings at 
 societal level, includes
 economic disruptions. 

**Q3**

* > Clearly the economic damage
is a serious concern, which
could compromise our society 
for a long period of time
and potentially stunt the
careers in life courses of 
countless young people who 
are at critical stages in
their careers and in their 
life development.  
 
* > anxiety around possibly
catching the illness, and, 
of course around economic
disruptions, which don\'t
look like they\'re going 
away anytime soon. 
 
* > Many people are without a
job. 
 
* > And I think in many cases, 
the income loss will never 
be recovered.  

### Social inequality

 Definition: widening
 inequalities between the more
 privileged and less privileged 
 people. 

**Q3**

* > And that\'s tragic. In North 
America, we\'re likely to
see that inequality trends 
which have already been
going in the wrong 
direction, are likely to be
exacerbated by this. 
 
* > One of the most salient one
is about the possibility 
that this pandemic is
actually exaggerating
initial inequality in a
community. 

### Educational inequality

 Definition: learning loss in low 
 income students, unequal
 education outcomes. 

**Q3**

* > But when the students go 
back to their homes, they go 
back to very different 
environments, the poorer 
students go back to the
least enriched environments, 
have the least opportunities 
for this enrichment, and as
a result, they see the 
steepest declines in their 
learning. Now, one of the
worst things about this is 
that those inequalities
accumulate over the years, 
which leads ultimately to a
substantial achievement gap
between the rich and poor. 
 
* > For example, from the
standpoint of schools, when
the children cannot no 
longer attend school in
person, some schools that
have more resources are able 
to adjust and change very
quickly they started 
offering classes online, 
whereas for other schools, 
they might not have the
technical support and
resources to do that to
offer classes online. Then 
what happens to the
students? And even if the
school were able to offer
online classes, are the
children able to attend
those online classes? It 
depends on the amount to 
current resources that they
have access to.  

### Decline in quality of education

 Definition: implementing online
 education without researching
 it, emergence of sub-par online
 education, without critical 
 peer-to-peer interactions.

**Q3**

* > It's internet education. 
There is something that goes 
on in a real classroom,
that\'s superior, to what
you can get, it\'s an
immediacy, a clear reading 
of body language and facial
expressions and so on, that
gets lost. 
 
* > I worry that people will be
using the internet education 
automatically without
seriously thinking about it, 
which would be a big 
problem. 

### Stunted child development

 Definition: long term 
 developmental consequences for 
 children (e.g., social, 
 educational). 

**Q3**

* > That's a real concern. I 
know that there are parents
who are worried about the
long-term consequences for 
this very fearful period on
their children. Parents that 
I know are worried that
their children will grow up
with an increasing, greater
sense of mistrust and fear 
of other people. 

## Unique Question 4 themes
**some also mentioned in Q5**

### Context sensitivity

 Definition: behaving in tune
 with the circumstances at hand,
 includes being in touch with the 
 norms of the society. 
 Contextualizing one's memories 
 to ensure they remain distinct.  

**Q4**

* > I think kind of the wisdom 
necessary, maybe is
something like this, some
sort of effort for cognitive 
strategy of
compartmentalizing the risk
of infection. So that even 
if I\'m reminded that a
casual social interaction
brings with it some
potential risk of disease
transmission, I resist the 
tendency to over generalize
that appraisal to simply 
view this person as a
non-trustworthy person.  
 
* > We need to master
sensitivity to the very
important role played by 
context in human psychology. 
The context in which 
interactions between 
individuals, between groups
take place determines to a 
great extent what these
interactions mean to us, and 
what they do to us, and this 
we cannot ignore and should
not ignore when it comes to
how we configure life in the 
future.  

### Long-term orientation

 Definition: not losing sight of
 the effects of what we do on
 future generations, maintaining
 a long-term rather than 
 short-term future perspective
 with regards to goals and 
 outcomes. 

**Q4**

* > You have to look at long 
term interests, as well as 
short term ones. And that\'s 
proven hard for people to
do. You have to look and 
say, what effect will this 
have on not only me when 
I\'m older, but on my
children and my
grandchildren and other
people\'s kids as well.
 
* > We still need to really come 
together as communities
discuss what happened, 
across multiple levels,
whether its political, 
economic, cultural, so that
we can learn from our
mistakes and plan for what 
we can do better next time 
we face a collective threat. 

**Q5**

* > The future is more important 
than short term
gratifications. That we
should never lose sight of 
the effects of what we do, 
not only on our own lives, 
but on the lives of others 
around the world, and of 
future generations.

### Patience

 Definition: having the capacity
 to accept/tolerate
 delay/trouble/suffering without
 getting angry or upset; being
 patient.

**Q4**

* > The first is patience. These 
things are not going to
reverse overnight. Even if 
we get government leaders
who are more competent and 
more willing to trust and
heed science, they\'re not 
going to just magically come 
in and make everything all 
right again, it\'s going to
take a lot of time to
restore the infrastructure 
and the base that\'s 
necessary for people to have 
trust in our institutions. 

**Q5**

* > Patience and resilience are
the two core components of 
wisdom, which I think we 
should all try to rely on in 
the coming months. 
 
* > People need to recognize 
that this too will pass. But 
one has to be patient. It\'s 
not going to pass just 
because we want it to pass.

### Social awareness

 Definition: having a sense of
 awareness of the people around 
 us (e.g., being aware who we are 
 interacting with, noticing
 others and their struggles).

**Q4**

* > An important first step is 
the sense of awareness. We 
need to be aware of the fact 
that although some of us 
might be adapting and
adjusting comfortably to 
these changes, there are 
people who are struggling
when trying to adapt.

### Strive for socio-economic equality

 Definition: recognizing & 
 addressing inequalities in
 society, both as individuals
 and/or as a society.

**Q4**

* > But at the same time, in the 
long term, it's very 
important to try to reduce 
wealth disparity and racial
discrimination. Since, it\'s 
a really the weak spot of
society, which is being
attacked by the virus. 
 
* > Humankind must come to 
understand that we share the 
earth's bounty and its 
vulnerability, both of those 
aspects of our being born. 
Secondly, good fortune is
not fairly distributed 
locally, nationally or 
internationally ever and 
never has been.

**Q5**

* > the most important part is 
now that we are from, you
know, personal level, but
also from the political and
collective level, make sure
that this last third that
has suffered the most, will
not bear all the costs of
the pandemic. And that\'s
something where we are all 
obliged to fight to programs 
to help them to give them
financial aid, but also to 
give them the needed 
resources so that they can 
also feel more empowered to
help themselves

## Unique Question 5 themes

### Agency & control

 Definition: establishing a sense 
 of agency---i.e., the ability to 
 intentionally change the
 environment---and 
 mastery/control of one's day to
 day life; framing pandemic as a
 manageable challenge. 

**Q5**

* > I think finding small ways 
in which we can hold on to 
that feeling of having some
sort of control would help 
us get through these 
difficult times. 
 
* > One of the things you have 
to do is, have something 
that you want to get out of
bed for, a lot of that has

new activities.
